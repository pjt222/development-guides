A library of executable skills, specialist agents, and pre-built teams for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and compatible AI tools. Define repeatable engineering procedures once and have AI agents execute them with built-in validation and error recovery. Compose specialists into review teams that catch issues a single reviewer would miss. Built on the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io).

## At a Glance

<!-- AUTO:START:stats -->
- **310 skills** across 55 domains — structured, executable procedures
- **64 agents** — specialized Claude Code personas covering development, review, compliance, and more
- **13 teams** — predefined multi-agent compositions for complex workflows
- **16 guides** — human-readable workflow, infrastructure, and reference documentation
- **Interactive visualization** — force-graph explorer with 310 R-generated skill icons and 9 color themes
<!-- AUTO:END:stats -->

## How It Works

| Building Block | Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| **[Skills](skills/README.md)** | `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` | Executable procedures (*how*) |
| **[Agents](agents/README.md)** | `agents/<name>.md` | Specialized personas (*who*) |
| **[Teams](teams/README.md)** | `teams/<name>.md` | Multi-agent compositions (*who works together*) |
| **[Guides](guides/README.md)** | `guides/<name>.md` | Human-readable reference (*context*) |

Ask Claude Code to review your R package, and the [r-package-review](teams/r-package-review.md) team activates 4 agents — each following specialized skills for code quality, architecture, security, and best practices — then synthesizes their findings into a single report.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
- This repository cloned: `git clone https://github.com/pjt222/agent-almanac.git`
- Node.js (for README generation and the visualization)

### Try it

In Claude Code, from this repository directory:

```
> "Use the code-reviewer agent to review my latest changes"
> "Follow the commit-changes skill to stage and commit"
> "Activate the r-package-review team to review this package"
```

### Make skills available as slash commands

```bash
ln -s ../../skills/commit-changes .claude/skills/commit-changes
# Then invoke with /commit-changes in Claude Code
```

### Explore visually

```bash
cd viz && npx vite
# Open http://localhost:5173 for the interactive force-graph explorer
```

See [viz/README.md](viz/README.md) for full build instructions.

If Agent Almanac makes your AI tools more capable, consider [sponsoring its development](https://github.com/sponsors/pjt222).

Reliable AI assistance requires structured knowledge — and maintaining that structure is work that the models themselves cannot do.
