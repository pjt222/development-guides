## What This Repository Contains

- **Skills, agents, teams, guides**: Markdown and YAML documentation. ~60% of skills (177 of 297) include `Bash` in their allowed-tools, meaning they instruct AI agents to execute shell commands when followed. Review any skill before letting an agent execute it.
- **Visualization pipeline** (`viz/`): A containerized R + Node.js + Vite build system with a Dockerfile, shell scripts, and an icon rendering pipeline. The Docker entrypoint serves content via a Python HTTP server.
- **Scripts** (`scripts/`): A Node.js script for README generation from registries.
- **Claude Code configuration** (`.claude/`): Agent discovery symlinks and permission settings.
