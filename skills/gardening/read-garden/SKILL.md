# Read Garden

Observe and assess a garden using a structured sensory protocol before making any intervention decisions.

## When to Use

- Before any intervention — read the garden first, act second
- Plants are showing stress symptoms (yellowing, wilting, curling, spots)
- Seasonal transitions (spring wakeup, autumn decline) need assessment
- New garden site evaluation before planting
- Regular (weekly or biweekly) garden health monitoring
- After extreme weather events (frost, heat wave, heavy rain)

## Inputs

- **Required**: Physical access to the garden
- **Required**: Garden journal or notebook for recording observations
- **Optional**: Previous observation records for comparison
- **Optional**: Soil thermometer, pH test strips, moisture meter
- **Optional**: Hand lens or magnifying glass (for pest/disease identification)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Meditate Checkpoint — Pre-Entry Clearing

Before entering the garden for assessment, clear preconceptions.

```
Pre-Garden Clearing (3-5 minutes):
1. Stand at the garden's edge — do not enter yet
2. Take three slow breaths (inhale 4 counts, exhale 6 counts)
3. Set aside what you expect to find:
   - "I think the tomatoes need water" → Set aside
   - "That pest spray probably didn't work" → Set aside
   - "The lettuce should be ready by now" → Set aside
4. Adopt the observer's stance: you are here to receive information,
   not confirm hypotheses
5. Let your eyes soften — peripheral vision, not focused scanning
6. When you feel neutral and receptive, enter the garden

Why this matters:
Gardeners who enter with a diagnosis in mind see confirmation
everywhere and miss what the garden is actually showing them.
Observation before interpretation is the foundation of good practice.
```

**Expected:** A calm, receptive state free from preconceptions about what you will find.

**On failure:** If you cannot release expectations (strong anxiety about a specific plant, frustration from recent losses), acknowledge the emotion, write it down as "AOL: [concern]", and proceed. Naming it reduces its influence.

### Step 2: Stage I — Gestalt Impression

Walk the garden perimeter. Record your first, unfiltered impression.

```
Gestalt Protocol:
1. Walk slowly around the entire garden boundary
2. Do NOT examine individual plants yet — take in the whole
3. Record your impression using only these categories:
   - Overall vigour: thriving / stable / declining
   - Dominant colour tone: deep green / pale / mixed / yellowing
   - Density: lush / adequate / sparse / bare patches
   - Energy: (subjective) vibrant / calm / tired / distressed
4. Note what draws your eye first — this is often the loudest signal
5. Record ambient conditions: temperature, wind, sky, soil moisture
   (visual), recent weather

Example Gestalt Record:
  Date: 2026-04-15, 9:30am, 14°C, overcast, light rain yesterday
  Overall: Stable, but northeast corner looks depleted
  Colour: Mixed — good green on brassicas, pale on tomato starts
  Density: Adequate except herb bed (sparse)
  Energy: Calm, not vibrant — spring is slow this year
  Eye drawn to: Wilting squash transplants (row 3)
```

**Expected:** A brief, holistic record of the garden's state without analysis or diagnosis.

**On failure:** If you immediately start diagnosing (e.g., "the squash is wilting because..."), write "AOL: [diagnosis]" and return to pure observation. Analysis comes in Stage III.

### Step 3: Stage II — Sensory Layer

Now move through the garden bed by bed. Engage all senses for each area.

```
Sensory Observation Protocol (per bed or zone):

LEAF LANGUAGE:
- Colour: Deep green, pale green, yellowing, purpling, browning
  - Yellowing (chlorosis): general = nitrogen, interveinal = iron/manganese
  - Purpling: phosphorus deficiency or cold stress
  - Browning: tip burn = salt/fertilizer, edge burn = potassium
- Curl direction:
  - Upward: heat stress, drought, herbicide exposure
  - Downward: overwatering, root damage
  - Inward (cupping): virus, mite damage
- Surface: Smooth, rough, sticky (aphid honeydew), powdery (mildew), spotted
- Underside: Check for eggs, mites (tiny dots), early mildew

STEM AND STRUCTURE:
- Strength: Upright and sturdy vs. leaning or lodged
- Colour: Normal woody/green vs. blackening (rot) or pale (etiolation)
- Flexibility: Supple (healthy) vs. brittle (dehydrated) vs. mushy (disease)
- Growth pattern: Normal internodes vs. elongated (light-seeking)

ROOT SIGNALS (check at soil line and during transplant):
- Colour: White/cream (healthy), brown/black (rot), orange (rust fungus)
- Smell: Earthy (healthy), sour/sulphurous (anaerobic rot)
- Structure: Fibrous network (good) vs. circling (pot-bound) vs. sparse (stress)

SOIL AT THE PLANT:
- Moisture: Dry and cracked / moist and dark / waterlogged and gleaming
- Surface: Mulched / bare / crusted / mossy / algae-covered
- Smell: Sweet and earthy (good) / sour (anaerobic) / musty (fungal)
- Inhabitants: Earthworms, beetles, spiders (good) / slugs, ants farming aphids (concerning)

Record each observation as a sensory descriptor — no analysis yet.
Wrong: "The tomatoes have early blight"
Right: "Tomato lower leaves: brown spots, concentric rings, yellowing around spots"
```

**Expected:** A detailed sensory record for each bed or zone, using descriptive language only.

**On failure:** If you catch yourself diagnosing (naming a disease, blaming a pest), write "AOL: [diagnosis]" and return to raw observation. The name comes later — the data comes first.

### Step 4: Stage III — Pattern Recognition

Now, and only now, begin connecting observations to patterns.

```
Pattern Analysis Protocol:
1. Review your Stage II notes for each bed
2. Ask these structured questions:

   SPATIAL:
   - Are symptoms localized (one plant, one bed) or systemic (whole garden)?
   - Is there a gradient? (Worse near a fence = shade; worse near path = compaction)
   - Are only certain species affected? (Host-specific = disease; all species = environmental)

   TEMPORAL:
   - Is this new growth or old growth?
     - New growth affected: nutrient deficiency (can't build new tissue)
     - Old growth affected: mobile nutrient being relocated, or infection spreading
   - Did symptoms appear suddenly (weather event, application) or gradually (chronic condition)?

   POPULATION:
   - One plant: likely individual issue (root damage, transplant shock)
   - One species: likely species-specific (disease, pest preference)
   - All plants: likely environmental (soil, water, weather)

3. Cross-reference with Five Indicators (leaf, stem, root, soil, phenology):
   - Do multiple indicators point to the same cause?
   - Convergent signals = higher confidence diagnosis
   - Contradictory signals = more observation needed

AOL Management:
If your mind jumps to a conclusion before the pattern analysis is complete:
- Write "AOL: [conclusion]" on a separate line
- Do NOT act on it yet
- Return to the data
- If the same conclusion re-emerges from multiple independent observations,
  it graduates from AOL to tentative diagnosis
- A tentative diagnosis is still not action — it's a hypothesis to test

Distinguish:
- Premature label (low evidence, high confidence) → dangerous
- Convergent conclusion (high evidence, proportional confidence) → actionable
```

**Expected:** One or more tentative diagnoses supported by multiple independent observations.

**On failure:** If no clear pattern emerges, the garden may be healthy (not everything is a problem) or the signals may be too early to read. Record observations and reassess in one week. Time often clarifies what a single visit cannot.

### Step 5: Heal Checkpoint — Garden Health Triage

Convert your observations into a prioritized action plan.

```
Garden Health Triage Matrix:
┌──────────┬──────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│ Priority │ Criteria                 │ Example Actions             │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ TODAY    │ Actively dying, wilting  │ Deep water. Emergency shade.│
│ (Red)    │ severely, pest           │ Hand-remove pests. Support  │
│          │ infestation visible      │ lodged stems.               │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ THIS     │ Declining but stable,    │ Feed (compost tea or foliar │
│ WEEK     │ nutrient deficiency      │ seaweed). Mulch bare soil.  │
│ (Amber)  │ symptoms, early disease  │ Improve drainage. Prune     │
│          │ signs                    │ affected foliage.           │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ WATCH    │ Subtle changes, early    │ Record in journal. Reassess │
│ (Green)  │ signs that may resolve   │ in 1 week. Take photos for  │
│          │ naturally, seasonal      │ comparison. Do NOT          │
│          │ transitions              │ intervene yet.              │
├──────────┼──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ HEALTHY  │ No issues observed,      │ Appreciate. Continue        │
│ (Blue)   │ vigorous growth, good    │ current care. Note what's   │
│          │ colour, active biology   │ working for future seasons. │
└──────────┴──────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

Triage Rules:
1. Address RED items immediately — everything else can wait
2. Address AMBER items this week — schedule specific days
3. GREEN items: observe only. Most "watch" items resolve themselves.
   The most common gardener error is treating green items as amber
4. BLUE items: actively note what's working — these are your successes
5. Never address more than 2 priorities per garden visit
   (doing too many things at once means doing nothing well)
```

**Expected:** A triaged action list with clear priorities and timeline.

**On failure:** If everything feels like a red priority, you may be in anxiety mode rather than observation mode. Return to the meditate checkpoint (Step 1) and re-enter. True emergencies are rare — most garden problems develop slowly and can wait a day.

### Step 6: Record and Track

Complete the observation session with a journal entry.

```
Garden Observation Record Template:
Date: ___________  Time: ___________
Weather: ___________  Recent weather: ___________

GESTALT: (1-2 sentences from Stage I)

BED-BY-BED OBSERVATIONS: (Stage II data)
  Bed 1: ___________
  Bed 2: ___________
  [...]

PATTERNS NOTED: (Stage III analysis)
  ___________

TRIAGE:
  RED (today): ___________
  AMBER (this week): ___________
  GREEN (watch): ___________
  BLUE (healthy): ___________

AOLs RECORDED: (list any premature conclusions that arose)
  ___________

ACTIONS TAKEN:
  ___________

COMPARE TO LAST VISIT:
  Improving: ___________
  Worsening: ___________
  Unchanged: ___________
```

**Expected:** A complete, dated observation record that can be compared to previous visits.

**On failure:** If journaling feels burdensome, reduce to the minimum: date, weather, triage summary, and one observation per bed. Consistency matters more than detail.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Meditate checkpoint completed before entering the garden
- [ ] Gestalt impression recorded before examining individual plants
- [ ] Sensory observations use descriptive language (no diagnosis in Stage II)
- [ ] AOLs identified and set aside (not acted upon prematurely)
- [ ] Pattern analysis considers spatial, temporal, and population factors
- [ ] Triage matrix completed with clear priority levels
- [ ] Observation record dated and filed in garden journal
- [ ] Actions proportional to triage level (no over-treatment of green items)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation bias**: Entering the garden looking for a specific problem guarantees you'll find it (or something that looks like it). The meditate checkpoint prevents this
2. **Diagnosing in Stage II**: Naming a disease during sensory observation biases all subsequent data collection. Stay with descriptors until Stage III
3. **Treating green as amber**: Most garden "problems" resolve themselves. Spraying or pruning at the first sign of anything often causes more harm than the original symptom
4. **Skipping the record**: Without a journal, every visit starts from scratch. Patterns only emerge over time — and time requires records
5. **AOL suppression vs. management**: The goal is not to have no analytical thoughts — that's impossible. The goal is to notice them, name them, and set them aside until the data supports or refutes them
6. **Over-intervention**: The garden reading protocol should increase confidence and reduce the number of actions taken, not increase them. If you're doing more after reading, you may be treating anxiety, not the garden
