# Cultivate Bonsai

Cultivate and maintain bonsai trees through seasonal care, structural shaping, and contemplative practice.

## When to Use

- You are selecting a species for your first or next bonsai
- You need to prune (maintenance or structural) a bonsai tree
- Your bonsai needs repotting (roots circling, soil depleted, or growth stalled)
- You want to wire branches for shaping
- You need a seasonal care calendar for an existing bonsai collection
- You want to develop a contemplative sitting practice with a living tree

## Inputs

- **Required**: Species of tree (or climate zone for species selection guidance)
- **Optional**: Current state of tree (age estimate, pot size, health, last repotting date)
- **Optional**: Goal style (formal upright, informal upright, cascade, semi-cascade, literati, windswept, forest)
- **Optional**: Season and current weather conditions
- **Optional**: Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Select or Assess the Species

Match species to climate, experience level, and desired aesthetic.

```
Beginner-Friendly Species by Climate:
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│ Climate            │ Species              │ Why                   │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Temperate (zones   │ Chinese elm           │ Forgiving, fast       │
│ 6-9)               │ (Ulmus parvifolia)   │ recovery, indoor/out  │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Temperate          │ Japanese maple        │ Beautiful foliage,    │
│                    │ (Acer palmatum)      │ deciduous drama       │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Cool (zones 4-7)   │ Juniper              │ Hardy, classic style, │
│                    │ (Juniperus)          │ tolerates wiring      │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Warm (zones 9-11)  │ Ficus retusa          │ Aerial roots, indoor  │
│                    │                      │ tolerant, fast growth │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│ Any (indoor)       │ Chinese privet        │ Nearly indestructible,│
│                    │ (Ligustrum sinense)  │ rapid budding         │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘

Selection Criteria:
1. Hardy in your zone (outdoor bonsai are healthier than indoor)
2. Tolerant of root pruning (essential for bonsai longevity)
3. Produces small leaves naturally or through technique (leaf reduction)
4. Available as nursery stock (don't start from seed — too slow for learning)
```

**Expected:** Species selected that matches climate, experience, and aesthetic goal.

**On failure:** If unsure about species suitability, default to Chinese elm — it tolerates the widest range of conditions and forgives beginner mistakes.

### Step 2: Meditate Checkpoint — Sitting with the Tree

Before any structural work (pruning, wiring, repotting), sit with the tree.

```
Bonsai Sitting Protocol (5-10 minutes):
1. Place the tree at eye level on a clean surface
2. Sit comfortably at arm's length
3. Observe without planning:
   - Where does the trunk move? Follow its line from base to apex
   - Which branches reach toward light? Which retreat?
   - Where is the tree's natural front? (The side that tells its story)
4. Resist the urge to "fix" anything. The tree has been growing
   toward its own form. Your job is to listen first, then collaborate.
5. When you feel you understand the tree's intention, you may begin work.

If you feel rushed or impatient, you are not ready. Return tomorrow.
```

**Expected:** Calm, unhurried state. A sense of the tree's natural movement and character.

**On failure:** If unable to quiet the planning mind, do not proceed to structural pruning. Maintenance watering and feeding may continue without this checkpoint.

### Step 3: Pruning

Two types: maintenance pruning (ongoing) and structural pruning (seasonal).

```
Maintenance Pruning (any time during growing season):
- Purpose: Maintain shape, encourage ramification (branching density)
- Tool: Sharp bypass secateurs or bonsai scissors
- Technique:
  - Deciduous: Cut back new shoots to 2-3 leaves once they extend to 6-8 leaves
  - Conifer: Pinch new candles by hand (never cut — it browns the needles)
  - Remove: Crossing branches, upward-growing interior shoots, dead wood

Structural Pruning (late winter for deciduous, early spring for conifer):
- Purpose: Establish or refine the tree's fundamental shape
- Tool: Concave cutter (creates a wound that heals flush)
- Technique:
  1. Identify the primary trunk line
  2. Select 3-5 primary branches (alternating left/right, decreasing in thickness upward)
  3. Remove competing leaders, bar branches (directly opposite), and wheel branches (multiple from same point)
  4. Cut flush to trunk with concave cutter — do NOT leave stubs
  5. Never remove more than 1/3 of foliage in one session

⚠️ CAUTION: Structural pruning is irreversible. If uncertain about
a branch, leave it for one more season. You can always remove later;
you cannot reattach.
```

**Expected:** Tree with cleaner silhouette, improved light penetration, and clear trunk line.

**On failure:** If too much foliage was removed, move tree to sheltered spot with dappled light. Reduce watering slightly (less foliage = less transpiration). Do not fertilize until new growth appears.

### Step 4: Wiring

Shape branches by wrapping them with anodized aluminium or annealed copper wire.

```
Wiring Protocol:
1. Select wire gauge: approximately 1/3 the diameter of the branch
2. Anchor wire by wrapping 2-3 turns around the trunk or a thicker branch
3. Wrap at 45° angle along the branch — consistent spacing, not too tight
4. Bend SLOWLY — listen for cracking. If you hear a crack, stop immediately
5. Wire in pairs: two branches of similar thickness with one piece of wire

Timing:
- Deciduous: Wire in winter (no leaves = better visibility)
- Conifer: Wire in late autumn (flexible sap)

Removal:
- Check monthly during growing season
- Remove BEFORE wire bites into bark (scarring is permanent)
- Cut wire off in small sections — never unwrap (risks branch breakage)

Common Errors:
- Wire too thin: branch springs back to original position
- Wire too tight: cuts into bark, leaves permanent scars
- Bending too fast: branch snaps at the wire point
```

**Expected:** Branches held in desired position without bark damage. Wire will be removed in 3-6 months.

**On failure:** If wire bites into bark, cut it off immediately. The scar will heal over 2-3 growing seasons. Apply cut paste to deep wounds.

### Step 5: Repotting

Repot when roots circle the pot interior or soil no longer drains freely.

```
Repotting Protocol:
1. Timing: Early spring, just as buds begin to swell (species-dependent)
   - Deciduous: When buds are visibly swelling but not yet open
   - Conifer: When new candles begin to elongate
   - Tropical: Any time in active growth (but spring is still safest)

2. Prepare soil mix:
   - Standard: Akadama 1 : Pumice 1 : Lava rock 1
   - Moisture-loving species: Add 1 part organic (bark or peat)
   - Arid species: Increase pumice ratio to 2 parts
   - Sift all components through 2mm and 6mm screens — discard dust and oversized

3. Remove from pot:
   - Run a root sickle around the pot interior
   - Lift tree gently — if stuck, do NOT pull by trunk
   - Use a chopstick to gently untangle the root mass from the outside in

4. Root pruning:
   - Remove no more than 1/3 of root mass
   - Cut circling roots back to where they radiate outward
   - Trim long taproots to encourage lateral feeder roots
   - Preserve fine, white feeder roots — these are the tree's lifeline

5. Place in pot:
   - Secure drainage mesh over holes
   - Thread anchor wires through drainage holes
   - Add a layer of soil, position tree, tie down with anchor wires
   - Fill around roots with chopstick — no air pockets
   - Top-dress with fine akadama or moss

6. Aftercare:
   - Water thoroughly until water runs clear from drainage holes
   - Place in sheltered spot — no direct sun for 2-3 weeks
   - Do NOT fertilize for 4-6 weeks (new roots need to establish)
```

**Expected:** Tree stable in pot, soil drains freely when watered, no wobble in trunk.

**On failure:** If tree shows severe wilting within days of repotting, too many roots were removed. Move to shade, mist foliage daily, and apply rooting hormone to next watering. Recovery takes 4-8 weeks.

### Step 6: Heal Checkpoint — Post-Repot Assessment

Two weeks after repotting, assess the tree's recovery.

```
Post-Repot Health Triage:
┌──────────────────┬────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ Indicator        │ Healthy                │ Stressed            │
├──────────────────┼────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ New buds         │ Swelling or opening    │ Static or browning  │
│ Leaf colour      │ Normal or light green  │ Yellowing or wilting│
│ Soil drainage    │ Water flows through    │ Pools on surface    │
│ Trunk stability  │ Firm, no wobble        │ Rocks when touched  │
│ Root zone smell  │ Earthy, neutral        │ Sour or musty       │
└──────────────────┴────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

If 3+ indicators show stress:
1. Move to dappled shade
2. Reduce watering frequency (but don't let soil dry completely)
3. Mist foliage morning and evening
4. Do NOT fertilize — stressed roots cannot absorb nutrients
5. Reassess at 4 weeks
```

**Expected:** Tree showing new bud activity and stable footing within 2-3 weeks.

**On failure:** If no new growth at 6 weeks and indicators remain stressed, the tree may need to be removed from the bonsai pot and placed in a larger recovery container with standard potting mix for one full growing season.

### Step 7: Seasonal Care Calendar

```
Bonsai Seasonal Calendar (Temperate Zones):
┌─────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Season  │ Tasks                                            │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Spring  │ Repot (early). Begin fertilizing (balanced).     │
│         │ Structural prune before bud break. Remove wire   │
│         │ from autumn. Move outdoor trees to growing area.  │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Summer  │ Maintenance pruning ongoing. Water daily (twice   │
│         │ in heat). Reduce fertilizer in peak heat. Watch   │
│         │ for pests (aphids, spider mites). Shade conifers  │
│         │ from afternoon sun if > 35°C / 95°F.             │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Autumn  │ Wire deciduous trees after leaf fall. Final       │
│         │ fertilize with low-nitrogen (0-10-10). Let        │
│         │ deciduous leaves fall naturally — don't strip.     │
│         │ Reduce watering as growth slows.                  │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Winter  │ Protect from hard freeze (unheated garage or cold │
│         │ frame for temperate species). Water sparingly —    │
│         │ soil should be just moist. Study, plan, sharpen   │
│         │ tools. Contemplate the tree's bare structure.     │
└─────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Expected:** Year-round care rhythm established with seasonal transitions.

**On failure:** If a seasonal task was missed (e.g., spring repot), wait until next year — out-of-season repotting is more dangerous than waiting.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Species appropriate for climate zone and experience level
- [ ] Meditate checkpoint completed before structural pruning or wiring
- [ ] No more than 1/3 of foliage removed in any single pruning session
- [ ] Wire gauge approximately 1/3 branch diameter, applied at 45°
- [ ] Soil mix sifted, free-draining, appropriate for species
- [ ] No more than 1/3 of root mass removed during repotting
- [ ] Heal checkpoint performed 2 weeks post-repot
- [ ] Seasonal care tasks aligned with current season

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-pruning**: Removing too much foliage weakens the tree. When in doubt, leave it
2. **Forgotten wire**: Wire left too long scars bark permanently. Set monthly reminders to check
3. **Wrong season for repotting**: Repotting in summer or mid-winter can kill the tree
4. **Overwatering**: More bonsai die from overwatering than underwatering. Check soil moisture before watering — not on a schedule
5. **Impatience**: Bonsai develop over decades. A tree shaped this year may not look finished for five years. This is the practice
6. **Indoor placement**: Most bonsai are outdoor trees. Indoor placement (except tropical species) leads to slow decline from insufficient light and dormancy disruption
