# Write Incident Runbook

Create actionable runbooks that guide responders through incident diagnosis and resolution.

## When to Use

- Documenting response procedures for recurring alerts or incidents
- Standardizing incident response across on-call rotation members
- Reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) with clear diagnostic steps
- Creating training materials for new team members on incident handling
- Establishing escalation paths and communication protocols
- Migrating tribal knowledge to written documentation
- Linking alerts to resolution procedures (alert annotations)

## Inputs

- **Required**: Incident or alert name/description
- **Required**: Historical incident data and resolution patterns
- **Optional**: Diagnostic queries (Prometheus, logs, traces)
- **Optional**: Escalation contacts and communication channels
- **Optional**: Previous incident post-mortems

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose Runbook Template Structure

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-1-runbook-template-examples) for complete template files.

Select an appropriate template based on incident type and complexity.

**Basic runbook template structure**:
```markdown
# [Alert/Incident Name] Runbook
## Overview | Severity | Symptoms
## Diagnostic Steps | Resolution Steps
## Escalation | Communication | Prevention | Related
```

**Advanced SRE runbook template** (excerpt):
```markdown
# [Service Name] - [Incident Type] Runbook

## Metadata
- Service, Owner, Severity, On-Call, Last Updated

## Diagnostic Phase
### Quick Health Check (< 5 min): Dashboard, error rate, deployments
### Detailed Investigation (5-20 min): Metrics, logs, traces, failure patterns
# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete template)
```

Key template components:
- **Metadata**: Service ownership, severity, on-call rotation
- **Diagnostic Phase**: Quick checks → detailed investigation → failure patterns
- **Resolution Phase**: Immediate mitigation → root cause fix → verification
- **Escalation**: Criteria and contact paths
- **Communication**: Internal/external templates
- **Prevention**: Short/long-term actions

**Expected:** Template selected matches incident complexity, sections appropriate for service type.

**On failure:**
- Start with basic template, iterate based on incident patterns
- Review industry examples (Google SRE books, vendor runbooks)
- Adapt template based on team feedback after first use

### Step 2: Document Diagnostic Procedures

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-2-complete-diagnostic-procedures) for complete diagnostic queries and decision trees.

Create step-by-step investigation procedures with specific queries.

**Six-step diagnostic checklist**:

1. **Verify Service Health**: Health endpoint checks and uptime metrics
   ```bash
   curl -I https://api.example.com/health  # Expected: HTTP 200 OK
   ```
   ```promql
   up{job="api-service"}  # Expected: 1 for all instances
   ```

2. **Check Error Rate**: Current error percentage and breakdown by endpoint
   ```promql
   sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
   / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) * 100  # Expected: < 1%
   ```

3. **Analyze Logs**: Recent errors and top error messages from Loki
   ```logql
   {job="api-service"} |= "error" | json | level="error"
   ```

4. **Check Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and connection pool status
   ```promql
   avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~"api-service.*"}[5m])) * 100
   # Expected: < 70%
   ```

5. **Review Recent Changes**: Deployments, git commits, infrastructure changes

6. **Examine Dependencies**: Downstream service health, database/API latency

**Failure pattern decision tree** (excerpt):
- Service down? → Check all pods/instances
- Error rate elevated? → Check specific error types (5xx, gateway, database, timeouts)
- When did it start? → After deployment (rollback), gradual (resource leak), sudden (traffic/dependency)

**Expected:** Diagnostic procedures are specific, include expected vs actual values, guide responder through investigation.

**On failure:**
- Test queries in actual monitoring system before documenting
- Include screenshots of dashboards for visual reference
- Add "Common mistakes" section for frequently missed steps
- Iterate based on feedback from incident responders

### Step 3: Define Resolution Procedures

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-3-complete-resolution-procedures) for all 5 resolution options with full commands and rollback procedures.

Document step-by-step remediation with rollback options.

**Five resolution options** (brief summary):

1. **Rollback Deployment** (fastest): For post-deployment errors
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service
   ```
   Verify → Monitor → Confirm resolution (error rate < 1%, latency normal, no alerts)

2. **Scale Up Resources**: For high CPU/memory, connection pool exhaustion
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/api-service --replicas=$((current * 3/2))
   ```

3. **Restart Service**: For memory leaks, stuck connections, cache corruption
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/api-service
   ```

4. **Feature Flag / Circuit Breaker**: For specific feature errors or external dependency failures
   ```bash
   kubectl set env deployment/api-service FEATURE_NAME=false
   ```

5. **Database Remediation**: For database connections, slow queries, pool exhaustion
   ```sql
   -- Kill long-running queries, restart connection pool, increase pool size
   ```

**Universal verification checklist**:
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Latency P99 < threshold
- [ ] Throughput at baseline
- [ ] Resource usage healthy (CPU < 70%, Memory < 80%)
- [ ] Dependencies healthy
- [ ] User-facing tests pass
- [ ] No active alerts

**Rollback procedure**: If resolution worsens situation → pause/cancel → revert → reassess

**Expected:** Resolution steps are clear, include verification checks, provide rollback options for each action.

**On failure:**
- Add more granular steps for complex procedures
- Include screenshots or diagrams for multi-step processes
- Document command outputs (expected vs actual)
- Create separate runbook for complex resolution procedures

### Step 4: Establish Escalation Paths

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-4-complete-escalation-guidelines) for full escalation levels and contact directory template.

Define when and how to escalate incidents.

**When to escalate immediately**:
- Customer-facing outage > 15 minutes
- SLO error budget > 10% depleted
- Data loss/corruption or security breach suspected
- Unable to identify root cause within 20 minutes
- Mitigation attempts fail or worsen situation

**Five escalation levels**:
1. **Primary On-Call** (5 min response): Deploy fixes, rollback, scale (up to 30 min solo)
2. **Secondary On-Call** (auto after 15 min): Additional investigation support
3. **Team Lead** (architectural decisions): Database changes, vendor escalation, incidents > 1 hour
4. **Incident Commander** (cross-team coord): Multiple teams, customer comms, incidents > 2 hours
5. **Executive** (C-level): Major impact (>50% users), SLA breach, media/PR, outages > 4 hours

**Escalation process**:
1. Notify target with: current status, impact, actions taken, help needed, dashboard link
2. Handoff if needed: share timeline, actions, access, remain available
3. Don't go silent: update every 15 min, ask questions, provide feedback

**Contact directory**: Maintain table with role, Slack, phone, PagerDuty for:
- Platform/Database/Security/Network teams
- Incident Commander
- External vendors (AWS, database vendor, CDN provider)

**Expected:** Clear criteria for escalation, contact information readily accessible, escalation paths aligned with organizational structure.

**On failure:**
- Validate contact information is current (test quarterly)
- Add decision tree for when to escalate
- Include examples of escalation messages
- Document response time expectations for each level

### Step 5: Create Communication Templates

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-5-complete-communication-templates) for all internal and external templates with full formatting.

Provide pre-written messages for incident updates.

**Internal templates** (Slack #incident-response):

1. **Initial Declaration**:
   ```
   🚨 INCIDENT: [Title] | Severity: [Critical/High/Medium]
   Impact: [users/services] | Owner: @username | Dashboard: [link]
   Quick Summary: [1-2 sentences] | Next update: 15 min
   ```

2. **Progress Update** (every 15-30 min):
   ```
   📊 UPDATE #N | Status: [Investigating/Mitigating/Monitoring]
   Actions: [what we tried and outcomes]
   Theory: [what we think is happening]
   Next: [planned actions]
   ```

3. **Mitigation Complete**:
   ```
   ✅ MITIGATION | Metrics: Error [before→after], Latency [before→after]
   Root Cause: [brief or "investigating"] | Monitoring 30min before resolved
   ```

4. **Resolution**:
   ```
   🎉 RESOLVED | Duration: [time] | Root Cause + Impact + Follow-up actions
   ```

5. **False Alarm**: No impact, no follow-up needed

**External templates** (status page):
- **Initial**: Investigating, started time, next update in 15 min
- **Progress**: Identified cause (customer-friendly), implementing fix, estimated resolution
- **Resolution**: Resolved time, root cause (simple), duration, prevention measures

**Customer email template**: Timeline, impact description, resolution, prevention, compensation (if applicable)

**Expected:** Templates save time during incidents, ensure consistent communication, reduce cognitive load on responders.

**On failure:**
- Customize templates to match company communication style
- Pre-fill templates with common incident types
- Create Slack workflow/bot to populate templates automatically
- Review templates during incident retrospectives

### Step 6: Link Runbook to Monitoring

> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md#step-6-alert-integration-examples) for complete Prometheus alert configuration and Grafana dashboard JSON.

Integrate runbook with alerts and dashboards.

**Add runbook links to Prometheus alerts**:
```yaml
- alert: HighErrorRate
  annotations:
    runbook_url: "https://wiki.example.com/runbooks/high-error-rate"
    dashboard_url: "https://grafana.example.com/d/service-overview"
    incident_channel: "#incident-platform"
```

**Embed quick diagnostic links in runbook**:
- Service Overview Dashboard
- Error Rate Last 1h (Prometheus direct link)
- Recent Error Logs (Loki/Grafana Explore)
- Recent Deployments (GitHub/CI)
- PagerDuty Incidents

**Create Grafana dashboard panel** with runbook links (markdown panel listing all incident runbooks with on-call and escalation info)

**Expected:** Responders can access runbooks directly from alerts or dashboards, diagnostic queries pre-filled, one-click access to relevant tools.

**On failure:**
- Verify runbook URLs are accessible without VPN/login
- Use URL shorteners for complex Grafana/Prometheus links
- Test links quarterly to ensure they don't break
- Create browser bookmarks for frequently used runbooks

## Validation

- [ ] Runbook follows consistent template structure
- [ ] Diagnostic procedures include specific queries and expected values
- [ ] Resolution steps are actionable with clear commands
- [ ] Escalation criteria and contacts are current
- [ ] Communication templates provided for internal and external audiences
- [ ] Runbook linked from monitoring alerts and dashboards
- [ ] Runbook tested during incident simulation or actual incident
- [ ] Feedback from responders incorporated into runbook
- [ ] Revision history tracked with dates and authors
- [ ] Runbook accessible without authentication (or cached offline)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too generic**: Runbooks with vague steps like "check the logs" without specific queries are not actionable. Be specific.
- **Outdated information**: Runbooks referencing old systems or commands become useless. Review quarterly.
- **No verification steps**: Resolution without verification leads to false positives. Always include "how to confirm it's fixed."
- **Missing rollback procedures**: Every action should have a rollback plan. Don't trap responders in worse state.
- **Assuming knowledge**: Runbooks for experts only exclude junior engineers. Write for the least experienced person on rotation.
- **No ownership**: Runbooks without owners become stale. Assign team/person responsible for updates.
- **Hidden behind auth**: Runbooks inaccessible during VPN/SSO issues are useless during crisis. Cache copies or use public wiki.
