# Practice Tai Chi

Develop a tai chi chuan practice that builds rooted structure, relaxed power, and martial awareness through slow, intentional movement and internal energy cultivation.

## When to Use

- Beginning or deepening a tai chi practice for health, martial skill, or both
- Developing whole-body coordination and relaxed structural alignment
- Cultivating internal energy (qi) awareness through movement
- Preparing the body for partner work or self-defense applications
- Complementing a meditation practice with moving mindfulness (see `mindfulness`, `meditate`)
- Building a low-impact daily movement practice suitable for any age or fitness level

## Inputs

- **Required**: Available space (minimum 3m x 3m for form practice, less for standing/silk reeling)
- **Required**: Comfortable clothing that does not restrict movement
- **Optional**: Practice surface preference (flat ground, grass, wood floor; avoid slippery surfaces)
- **Optional**: Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced; default: beginner)
- **Optional**: Focus area (health/relaxation, martial application, competition form; default: health)
- **Optional**: Available practice time (minimum 15 minutes; recommended 30-60 minutes)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish Foundation (Zhan Zhuang)

Standing meditation builds root, structural alignment, and internal awareness — the foundation of all tai chi movement.

```
Stance Progression:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│ Stance           │ Duration (build to)      │ Focus                         │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ Wuji (neutral)  │ 5-10 minutes             │ Relaxation, vertical alignment│
│                  │                          │ Weight sinking to feet        │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ Holding the Ball │ 5-15 minutes             │ Arm structure, peng (ward-off)│
│ (cheng bao)     │                          │ energy, shoulder release      │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ Three-Circle     │ 10-20 minutes            │ Full-body connection, qi      │
│ (san ti shi)    │                          │ circulation, root depth       │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

Wuji standing alignment:
1. Feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward
2. Knees slightly bent — never locked, never past the toes
3. Pelvis tucked slightly (posterior tilt) to straighten the lower back
4. Spine elongated — imagine being suspended from a string at the crown
5. Shoulders relaxed and dropped, arms hanging naturally
6. Chin tucked slightly, tongue on the roof of the mouth
7. Breathe naturally through the nose, letting the belly expand on inhale
8. Hold for 5 minutes minimum, building to 20+ minutes over weeks

**Expected:** After 3-5 minutes, legs may tremble (normal muscular adaptation). After consistent practice, a sense of heaviness in the feet, warmth in the hands, and quiet alertness develops.

**On failure:** If knee pain occurs, check alignment — knees must track over toes and should not collapse inward. Reduce the depth of the bend. If lightheadedness occurs, ensure you are breathing naturally (not holding the breath). Shorten the duration and build gradually — forcing long stands too early creates tension rather than releasing it.

### Step 2: Practice Silk Reeling (Chan Si Gong)

Silk reeling exercises develop the spiraling, whole-body movement that distinguishes tai chi from external martial arts.

1. From wuji stance, shift weight to the right leg (70/30 distribution)
2. Begin single-arm silk reeling: right arm traces a continuous figure-eight in front of the body
3. The movement originates from the waist (dantian rotation), not the shoulder
4. The arm follows the waist — never moves independently
5. Coordinate breath: inhale as the hand rises, exhale as it descends
6. Practice 10-20 repetitions per side, then switch to the left arm
7. Progress to double-arm silk reeling: both arms spiral in coordinated opposition
8. Add weight shifting: as the waist turns, weight flows between legs like water

Key principles:
- Every movement is a continuous spiral — no straight lines, no stops
- The whole body moves as one unit: feet, knees, hips, waist, shoulders, elbows, hands
- Maintain the "six harmonies": shoulders-hips, elbows-knees, hands-feet (external); mind-intent, intent-qi, qi-force (internal)

**Expected:** Smooth, continuous spiraling movements where the arm follows the waist rotation naturally. The movement looks effortless and feels connected from feet to fingertips.

**On failure:** If the arm moves independently of the waist, slow down dramatically. Place your non-moving hand on your lower abdomen (dantian) to feel the rotation initiating there. If movement feels choppy, reduce the range of motion — a small, smooth circle is better than a large, jerky one.

### Step 3: Learn the Form Sequence (Yang 24)

The Yang-style 24-movement form is the standard entry point, containing the essential postures and transitions.

```
Form Movement Categories:
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Category           │ Key Movements            │ Martial Application      │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Ward-off/Roll-back │ Peng, Lu, Ji, An         │ Deflect, redirect, press,│
│ (Four Directions)  │ (Grasp Sparrow's Tail)   │ push — the four core     │
│                    │                          │ energies of tai chi      │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Strikes            │ Brush Knee, Deflect-     │ Palm strikes, punches,   │
│                    │ Parry-Punch, Apparent    │ closing techniques       │
│                    │ Close Up                 │                          │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Kicks              │ Right/Left Heel Kick,    │ Leg attacks to knee,     │
│                    │ Golden Rooster Stands    │ thigh, and midsection    │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Transitions        │ Cloud Hands, Wave Hands, │ Evasion, weight shifting,│
│                    │ Single Whip              │ positional advantage     │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

Learning approach:
1. Learn 2-3 movements per week — memorize the sequence first, refine later
2. Practice each new section 10 times before adding the next
3. Focus on smooth transitions between postures, not just the endpoints
4. Maintain consistent height (no bobbing up and down between movements)
5. Keep weight distribution clear: 70/30 or 100/0, never 50/50 (except opening/closing)
6. Once the full 24 is memorized, practice the complete form 3-5 times per session
7. One full run of the 24-form takes approximately 5-8 minutes at proper speed

**Expected:** After 2-3 months of consistent practice, the full 24-form sequence is memorized and can be performed continuously without stopping to recall the next movement.

**On failure:** If a transition is forgotten, return to the last known posture and restart from there rather than guessing. Video reference is valuable for self-study but cannot replace the kinesthetic feedback of a qualified instructor. If movements feel mechanical, return to silk reeling (Step 2) to reconnect with the spiraling quality.

### Step 4: Understand Martial Applications

Every posture in the form has a martial application. Understanding the intent transforms the form from dance into martial art.

1. Take each posture and ask: "What is this doing to an opponent?"
2. Ward Off (peng): intercepts and deflects an incoming force upward and outward
3. Roll Back (lu): redirects force by yielding and turning the waist
4. Press (ji): closes distance with whole-body forward pressure
5. Push (an): uproots the opponent by pushing through their center of gravity
6. Single Whip: simultaneous hook hand controls one arm while the other strikes
7. Practice each application slowly with a partner, focusing on structure over speed
8. The application should work through alignment and timing, not muscular force

**Expected:** Each form posture gains a clear martial meaning. Practice with a compliant partner reveals whether structural alignment is correct — if you must use force, the structure is wrong.

**On failure:** If applications feel forced or ineffective, revisit the posture in the form and check: Is the waist driving the movement? Is the weight grounded? Is the spine upright? Martial effectiveness in tai chi comes from correct structure, not from aggression. Seek an instructor who teaches the martial side alongside the health form.

### Step 5: Practice Push Hands (Tui Shou)

Push hands is the bridge between solo form and free application. It develops sensitivity to an opponent's force and intent.

1. Begin with single-hand fixed-step push hands: partners face each other, wrists touching
2. One partner pushes gently, the other yields and redirects using waist rotation
3. Maintain contact — "listening" (ting jin) to the partner's force, direction, and balance
4. Progress to double-hand push hands: both hands engaged, circular patterns
5. Add moving-step push hands: partners advance and retreat while maintaining contact
6. Practice the four core skills: adhere (zhan), connect (lian), stick (nian), follow (sui)
7. Test the principle: when pushed, do not resist; when pulled, do not lean forward

Key sensitivities to develop:
- Detect the moment your partner begins to commit force (before it arrives)
- Feel when your partner's root is compromised (weight shifts to heels or toes)
- Redirect incoming force to empty space rather than meeting it head-on

**Expected:** With practice, the ability to feel an opponent's intent through touch. Successful yielding feels like the push "falls into nothing." Successful issuing feels effortless — the partner is uprooted before they realize it.

**On failure:** If push hands becomes a shoving match, both partners should stop, return to wuji standing for 1 minute, then restart at a slower pace. Competitive ego is the primary obstacle. The goal is not to win but to develop sensitivity. If no partner is available, practice the yielding and issuing patterns solo against a wall or heavy bag, focusing on whole-body connection.

### Step 6: Integrate Breath and Internal Energy

Conscious breath and qi (internal energy) integration deepens the practice beyond physical movement.

1. During form practice, coordinate breath with movement:
   - Inhale on rising, opening, and gathering movements
   - Exhale on sinking, closing, and issuing movements
   - Never force the breath to match — slow the movement to match the breath instead
2. Direct attention to the lower dantian (3 finger-widths below the navel, inward):
   - This is the center of gravity and the energetic origin of movement
   - Visualize breath gathering here on the inhale, dispersing through the limbs on the exhale
3. Practice reverse abdominal breathing (intermediate):
   - Inhale: belly draws in slightly, pelvic floor lifts gently
   - Exhale: belly expands, pelvic floor releases
   - This builds internal pressure that supports martial power (fa jin)
4. Cultivate "song" (relaxed sinking): on every exhale, release tension from shoulders to feet
5. With practice, notice warmth, tingling, or a sense of flow in the hands and arms during form practice — this is qi awareness developing

**Expected:** Movement and breath become naturally synchronized. A sense of calm energy pervades the practice. The form feels less like physical exercise and more like moving meditation.

**On failure:** If breath coordination creates tension or lightheadedness, drop the breath focus and return to natural breathing while moving. Breath integration develops gradually — forcing it creates the opposite of the desired relaxation. Return to this step after 3-6 months of consistent form practice.

### Step 7: Apply in Context

Build tai chi into daily life as a sustainable practice.

1. Morning practice (recommended): 5 minutes standing, 5 minutes silk reeling, 10-20 minutes form
2. Integrate tai chi principles throughout the day:
   - Standing in line: practice wuji alignment (relax shoulders, sink weight)
   - Walking: maintain awareness of weight transfer and whole-body connection
   - Sitting: keep spine aligned, feet grounded
3. Complement with seated meditation (see `meditate`) for mental stillness
4. Complement with defensive mindfulness (see `mindfulness`) for situational awareness
5. If interested in the martial dimension, seek a school that teaches push hands and applications
6. Practice outdoors when possible — fresh air and uneven ground develop balance and root

**Expected:** Tai chi principles begin to influence posture, movement quality, and stress response throughout daily activities. Practice becomes a welcome routine rather than a chore.

**On failure:** If practice becomes inconsistent, shorten the session rather than skipping it. Five minutes of standing meditation daily is more valuable than one hour weekly. If motivation wanes, vary the practice: alternate form days with standing-only days, or practice to music.

## Validation

- [ ] Wuji standing can be maintained for at least 5 minutes without significant discomfort
- [ ] Silk reeling movements originate from the waist, not the shoulders
- [ ] Form sequence is memorized and can be performed continuously
- [ ] At least 3 postures can be explained in terms of martial application
- [ ] Weight distribution is clear in every posture (no habitual 50/50)
- [ ] Breath does not become forced or held during form practice
- [ ] Practice session includes standing, silk reeling, and form (all three components)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Leading with the arms**: In tai chi, the waist moves first and the arms follow. If the hands arrive before the waist turns, the movement has no power and no connection. Always initiate from the center
- **Locked knees or over-bending**: Locked knees cut off root; over-bending strains the joint. Keep a soft, springy bend that allows the weight to sink into the feet
- **Rising and falling between postures**: Maintain a consistent height throughout the form. The head should travel on a level plane. Rising and falling wastes energy and breaks structural integrity
- **Rushing the form**: Tai chi is deliberately slow. If the 24-form takes less than 5 minutes, it is too fast. Slowness develops awareness, balance, and internal connection
- **Neglecting standing practice**: The form is built on the foundation of standing. Skipping zhan zhuang is like building a house without a foundation — the structure will be unstable
