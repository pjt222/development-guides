# Mushroom Cultivation

Cultivate edible and medicinal mushrooms from spawn through fruiting at home scale.

## When to Use

- You want to grow edible mushrooms without the risks of wild foraging
- You have a suitable indoor or outdoor space for mushroom cultivation
- You want to experiment with different species and substrates
- You need a reliable supply of fresh mushrooms (culinary or medicinal)
- You are interested in mycelial ecology and want hands-on experience

## Inputs

- **Required**: Mushroom spawn (grain spawn, sawdust spawn, or plug spawn from a reputable supplier)
- **Required**: Substrate material (straw, hardwood sawdust, logs, or supplemented sawdust)
- **Optional**: Pressure cooker or large pot (for substrate sterilization/pasteurization)
- **Optional**: Growing containers (bags, buckets, or logs)
- **Optional**: Spray bottle and humidity gauge
- **Optional**: Thermometer for monitoring temperature

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose Your Species

Match species to your environment and experience level.

```
Beginner-Friendly Species:
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Species            | Substrate        | Temperature      | Difficulty       |
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Oyster mushroom    | Straw, coffee    | 15-24C (60-75F)  | Very easy        |
| (Pleurotus spp.)   | grounds, sawdust |                  | (most forgiving) |
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Shiitake           | Hardwood logs    | 13-21C (55-70F)  | Easy             |
| (Lentinula edodes) | or sawdust blocks|                  | (outdoor logs)   |
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Lion's mane        | Hardwood sawdust | 18-24C (65-75F)  | Moderate         |
| (Hericium          | (supplemented)   |                  | (needs humidity) |
| erinaceus)         |                  |                  |                  |
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Wine cap           | Wood chips,      | 10-27C (50-80F)  | Easy             |
| (Stropharia        | straw mulch      |                  | (outdoor beds)   |
| rugosoannulata)    | (outdoor beds)   |                  |                  |
+--------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+

Start with oyster mushrooms — they colonize fast, fruit reliably,
and tolerate imperfect conditions.
```

**Expected:** Species selected that matches your environment, substrate availability, and experience level.

**On failure:** If unsure, start with blue oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) on straw. It is the most forgiving species for beginners.

### Step 2: Prepare the Substrate

The substrate provides nutrition for the mycelium. It must be clean enough to give your mushroom a head start over competitors.

```
Substrate Preparation Methods:

PASTEURIZATION (for straw — easiest):
1. Chop straw to 2-4 inch lengths
2. Submerge in hot water (65-80C / 150-175F) for 60-90 minutes
3. Drain thoroughly — substrate should be moist but not dripping
   (squeeze test: a firm squeeze produces a few drops, not a stream)
4. Cool to below 30C (85F) before inoculation

STERILIZATION (for supplemented sawdust — more reliable):
1. Mix hardwood sawdust with 10-20% wheat bran or soy hull
2. Hydrate to 60-65% moisture content
3. Fill into autoclavable bags with filter patches
4. Pressure cook at 15 PSI for 90-120 minutes
5. Cool completely before inoculation (overnight is safest)

COLD WATER LIME BATH (alternative pasteurization):
1. Dissolve hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) in cold water
   (approximately 1 cup per 50 gallons)
2. pH should reach 12+ (kills competitors without heat)
3. Soak straw for 12-18 hours
4. Drain and let excess water drip for 2-4 hours
5. pH will neutralize as the straw dries
```

**Expected:** Substrate is clean (pasteurized or sterilized), at correct moisture content, and cooled to room temperature.

**On failure:** If contamination appears after inoculation (green mold within the first week), the substrate was insufficiently pasteurized or the inoculation environment was too dirty. Start fresh with more rigorous pasteurization.

### Step 3: Inoculate

Introduce spawn to the prepared substrate.

```
Inoculation Protocol:
1. Work in a clean environment: wash hands, clean surfaces, minimize airflow
   (still air is better than a breeze carrying contaminants)
2. Spawn rate: 10-20% spawn by weight relative to wet substrate
   (more spawn = faster colonization = less contamination risk)
3. Mix spawn thoroughly into the substrate (for bags/buckets)
   OR layer spawn between substrate layers
4. Pack into growing container:
   - Grow bags: fill loosely, fold and clip top
   - 5-gallon buckets: drill 1/2" holes in sides (every 6 inches),
     fill with inoculated substrate, cap loosely
   - Logs: drill holes, insert plug spawn, seal with wax
5. Label with species, date, and substrate type

Hygiene Priorities:
- Clean hands and surfaces
- Minimize time substrate is exposed to open air
- Work quickly and confidently
- If you touch a contaminated surface, re-clean before continuing
```

**Expected:** Spawn is evenly distributed throughout the substrate in a clean container, ready for incubation.

**On failure:** If spawn does not seem to be colonizing after 7-10 days (no visible white growth), check temperature (too cold slows growth), substrate moisture (too dry inhibits growth), and spawn viability (old or heat-damaged spawn may be dead).

### Step 4: Incubate

The mycelium colonizes the substrate during incubation.

```
Incubation Conditions:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Parameter          | Target                                   |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Temperature        | Species-specific (generally 20-25C /     |
|                    | 68-77F for most species)                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Light              | Dark or dim — direct light not needed    |
|                    | during colonization                      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Air exchange       | Minimal — CO2 buildup is acceptable      |
|                    | during colonization (loose lid is enough)|
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Duration           | 2-4 weeks (until substrate is fully      |
|                    | white with mycelium)                     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Monitoring         | Check every 3-4 days for contamination   |
|                    | (green, black, orange, or pink mold)     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+

Contamination Response:
- Green mold (Trichoderma): most common competitor. If localized and
  small, remove the contaminated area. If widespread, discard the
  entire block/bag — Trichoderma wins once established.
- Black mold: discard immediately. Do not open indoors.
- Orange/pink: bacterial contamination from wet substrate. Discard.
```

**Expected:** Full colonization — the substrate is uniformly white with mycelium and smells pleasantly mushroomy.

**On failure:** Partial colonization with contamination means the race was lost. Start again with more spawn (higher ratio), better pasteurization, and cleaner inoculation practice.

### Step 5: Initiate Fruiting

Trigger the transition from vegetative growth to mushroom formation.

```
Fruiting Triggers:
1. Fresh air: increase air exchange (open container, fan nearby)
2. Light: indirect light for 12 hours/day (any spectrum works)
3. Temperature drop: reduce by 5-10C from incubation temperature
4. Humidity: maintain 85-95% relative humidity
   - Mist 2-3 times daily
   - Or use a fruiting chamber (plastic tub with perlite floor)
5. For bags: cut X-shaped slits where you want mushrooms to emerge
   For buckets: mushrooms emerge from the drilled holes

Fruiting Chamber (Simple SGFC — Shotgun Fruiting Chamber):
- Large plastic storage tub (50-100L)
- Drill 1/4" holes every 2 inches on all 6 sides (including bottom and lid)
- 4-5 inch layer of wet perlite on the bottom
- Place colonized blocks/bags on a wire rack above the perlite
- Mist walls 2-3 times daily
- Fan fresh air in by waving the lid 2-3 times daily
```

**Expected:** Primordia (tiny mushroom pins) appear within 5-14 days of fruiting initiation.

**On failure:** If no pins appear after 2 weeks: check humidity (too dry is the most common cause), light (some species need light to pin), and temperature (too warm delays pinning for many species).

### Step 6: Harvest and Manage Successive Flushes

```
Harvest Timing:
- Harvest just before or as the cap edges begin to flatten or turn upward
- For oysters: when the cap edges are still slightly curled downward
- For shiitake: when the cap is 70-80% open (partial veil still intact)
- For lion's mane: when spines are 0.5-1 cm long and still firm

Harvest Technique:
- Twist and pull gently at the base (preferred for most species)
- Or cut with a clean knife at the substrate surface
- Do not leave stumps that can rot and attract contamination

Successive Flushes:
- After harvesting, soak the block/bag in cold water for 12-24 hours
  (rehydration triggers the next flush)
- Return to fruiting conditions
- Expect 2-4 flushes, each smaller than the last
- Total yield: approximately 25-50% of wet substrate weight
  for oyster mushrooms over all flushes
```

**Expected:** Fresh mushrooms harvested at optimal timing, with successive flushes extending the productive life of the substrate.

**On failure:** If yields are poor (small, sparse mushrooms), the substrate may be depleted or contaminated. Supplemented substrates produce higher yields. If contamination appears between flushes, the block's productive life is over — compost it.

## Validation

- [ ] Species appropriate for environment and experience level
- [ ] Substrate was properly pasteurized or sterilized
- [ ] Spawn rate was 10-20% by weight
- [ ] Inoculation was performed with clean technique
- [ ] Full colonization was achieved before initiating fruiting
- [ ] Fruiting conditions (humidity, temperature, air exchange, light) were maintained
- [ ] Mushrooms were harvested at optimal timing
- [ ] Successive flushes were managed through rehydration

## Common Pitfalls

- **Insufficient pasteurization**: The most common cause of failure. If contaminants appear within the first week, pasteurization was inadequate
- **Too little spawn**: Low spawn rates mean slow colonization, giving competitors more time. Use the recommended 10-20% ratio
- **Low humidity during fruiting**: Mushrooms are 90% water. If the air is dry, primordia abort (dry out before developing). Humidity below 80% during fruiting is too low
- **No fresh air exchange**: High CO2 during fruiting produces long, thin stems and small caps. Increase air exchange if stems are elongated
- **Harvesting too late**: Over-mature mushrooms drop spores (messy) and have shorter shelf life. Harvest on the early side
- **Contamination panic**: A small spot of mold on an otherwise healthy block is not necessarily fatal. Isolate the block, remove the contaminated area, and monitor. Discard only if contamination is spreading
