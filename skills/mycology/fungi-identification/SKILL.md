# Fungi Identification

Identify fungi in the field using morphological features, spore prints, habitat, and season with an absolute safety-first approach.

## When to Use

- You encounter an unknown fungus and need to identify it
- You are foraging for edible mushrooms and need to confirm species before consumption
- You want to assess whether fungi in your garden or property are harmful
- You are building field identification skills through structured observation practice
- You need to differentiate an edible species from a dangerous look-alike

## Inputs

- **Required**: A fungus specimen or clear observation of one in situ
- **Required**: Ability to observe fine morphological details (cap, gills, stem, base)
- **Optional**: Field guide or reference material for the region
- **Optional**: Paper and glass for spore prints
- **Optional**: Knife for cross-section examination
- **Optional**: Hand lens (10x) for fine detail

## Procedure

### Step 1: The Cardinal Rule

Before any identification work, internalize the absolute rule of mycology.

```
CARDINAL RULE:
If you are not 100% certain of the identification, DO NOT EAT IT.

There is no "universal edibility test" for mushrooms.
Some deadly species taste pleasant.
Some deadly species have delayed symptoms (24-72 hours).
Some deadly species have NO antidote.

The cost of a false positive (eating a misidentified mushroom) is
organ failure and death. The cost of a false negative (skipping an
edible mushroom) is a missed meal.

ALWAYS ERR TOWARD CAUTION.
```

**Expected:** The cardinal rule is internalized before proceeding with identification.

**On failure:** There is no failure mode for this step. If the rule is not internalized, do not proceed to field identification for consumption purposes.

### Step 2: Document the Habitat

Context narrows identification before touching the specimen.

```
Habitat Recording:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Factor             | Record                                   |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Substrate          | Soil, wood (dead/living), dung, leaf      |
|                    | litter, moss, other fungi                |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Tree association   | What trees are within 10m? (Many fungi    |
|                    | are mycorrhizal with specific tree genera)|
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Moisture           | Dry, damp, wet, waterlogged              |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Light              | Full shade, dappled, open                |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Season             | Early spring, late spring, summer, early  |
|                    | autumn, late autumn, winter              |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Altitude           | Lowland, mid-altitude, montane           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Growth pattern     | Solitary, scattered, clustered, ring,    |
|                    | shelf/bracket                            |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

**Expected:** A complete habitat record that provides context for species-level identification.

**On failure:** If habitat is unclear (e.g., urban garden with mixed plantings), record what is visible. Incomplete habitat data reduces identification confidence — factor this into the safety assessment.

### Step 3: Examine Morphological Features

Systematic examination of the specimen itself.

```
Morphological Checklist:

CAP (Pileus):
- Shape: convex, flat, concave, conical, umbonate, bell-shaped
- Diameter (measure or estimate)
- Surface: smooth, scaly, fibrous, slimy, dry, cracked
- Colour (note if colour changes with age or moisture)
- Margin: smooth, striate, inrolled, appendiculate (veil remnants)

GILLS / PORES / SPINES (Hymenium):
- Type: gills (lamellae), pores (tubes), spines (teeth), smooth
- Attachment: free, adnexed, adnate, decurrent
- Spacing: crowded, close, distant
- Colour (important — note changes with age)
- Bruising: do gills change colour when damaged?

STEM (Stipe):
- Height and diameter
- Shape: equal, tapered, bulbous, club-shaped
- Surface: smooth, fibrous, scaly, reticulate (netted)
- Interior: solid, hollow, stuffed (pithy center)
- Ring (annulus): present/absent, position, persistent/fragile
- Volva (cup at base): present/absent — ALWAYS check by
  carefully excavating the base (Amanita species have a volva)

FLESH (Context):
- Colour when cut
- Colour change on exposure to air (note time to change)
- Texture: firm, brittle, fibrous, gelatinous
- Smell: mushroomy, anise, radish, flour, chlorine, unpleasant
- Taste: (ONLY if species is confirmed non-deadly by an expert;
  for unknown species, DO NOT taste)

SPORE PRINT:
- Remove the stem; place the cap gill-side down on paper
  (half white, half dark paper to see any colour)
- Cover with a glass or bowl to maintain humidity
- Wait 4-12 hours
- Record spore colour: white, cream, pink, brown, purple-brown,
  black, rust-orange
```

**Expected:** A complete morphological description covering all major features.

**On failure:** If a feature cannot be observed (e.g., no ring visible but it may have been lost), record it as "not observed" rather than "absent." The distinction matters for identification.

### Step 4: Identify Using Multiple Confirmations

Cross-reference all data against reference material.

```
Identification Protocol:
1. Use habitat + season to narrow to likely genera
2. Use cap shape + gill type + spore colour to narrow to species group
3. Check ALL features against the candidate species description
4. Specifically check against dangerous look-alikes:
   - Does this species have a deadly doppelganger?
   - What feature distinguishes the edible from the deadly?
   - Can I see that distinguishing feature clearly?

Confidence Levels:
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Level    | Criteria                  | Action                    |
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Certain  | All features match; no    | Safe to collect (for      |
|          | look-alike confusion;     | experienced identifiers)  |
|          | experienced with species  |                           |
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Probable | Most features match;      | DO NOT eat. Collect for   |
|          | one or two uncertain;     | further study (spore      |
|          | look-alike eliminated     | print, expert review)     |
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Possible | Some features match;      | DO NOT eat. Photograph    |
|          | look-alike not fully      | and seek expert opinion   |
|          | eliminated                |                           |
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Unknown  | Cannot narrow to species  | DO NOT eat. DO NOT        |
|          |                          | handle extensively        |
+----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
```

**Expected:** A species-level identification with explicit confidence level and look-alike assessment.

**On failure:** If identification stalls at genus level, that is acceptable for learning purposes. For consumption, only species-level "Certain" identification is acceptable.

## Validation

- [ ] The cardinal rule was acknowledged before starting identification
- [ ] Habitat was documented before examining the specimen
- [ ] All morphological features were examined systematically
- [ ] The base was excavated to check for a volva
- [ ] A spore print was taken (if time allows)
- [ ] Dangerous look-alikes were explicitly checked and eliminated
- [ ] Confidence level was honestly assessed
- [ ] Only "Certain" identifications were considered for consumption

## Common Pitfalls

- **Relying on a single feature**: "It looks like a chanterelle" based on colour alone. True chanterelles have false gills (ridges), grow from soil near trees, and have a specific apricot smell. False chanterelles and Jack-o'-lanterns share the colour but differ in every other feature
- **Skipping the base examination**: Failing to dig up the base misses the volva — the single most important feature for identifying deadly Amanita species (death cap, destroying angel)
- **Trusting apps blindly**: AI-based mushroom identification apps have significant error rates for look-alike species. Use them as a starting point, never as confirmation
- **Assuming "common = safe"**: Abundance does not indicate edibility. Deadly species can be locally abundant
- **Tasting unknown species**: Some mycologists use taste as a diagnostic tool, but this requires expert-level knowledge of which species are safe to taste. For non-experts, do not taste unknown fungi
- **Ignoring temporal toxins**: Some species (e.g., Amanita phalloides) have pleasant taste and delayed symptoms. By the time symptoms appear (24-48 hours), liver damage is severe
