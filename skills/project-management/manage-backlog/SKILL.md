# Manage a Product Backlog

Create, prioritize, and maintain a backlog of work items that serves as the single source of truth for what needs to be done, applicable to both agile and classic project methodologies.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project and converting scope into actionable items
- Ongoing backlog grooming before sprint planning
- Re-prioritizing work after stakeholder feedback or scope changes
- Splitting oversized items into implementable pieces
- Reviewing and archiving completed or cancelled items

## Inputs

- **Required**: Project scope (from charter, WBS, or stakeholder input)
- **Optional**: Existing backlog file (BACKLOG.md) to update
- **Optional**: Prioritization framework preference (MoSCoW, value/effort, WSJF)
- **Optional**: Estimation scale (story points, T-shirt sizes, person-days)
- **Optional**: Sprint or iteration feedback requiring backlog updates

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create or Load Backlog Structure

If no backlog exists, create BACKLOG.md with standard columns. If one exists, read and validate structure.

```markdown
# Product Backlog: [Project Name]
## Last Updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Summary
- **Total Items**: [N]
- **Ready for Sprint**: [N]
- **In Progress**: [N]
- **Done**: [N]
- **Cancelled**: [N]

### Backlog Items
| ID | Title | Type | Priority | Estimate | Status | Sprint |
|----|-------|------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| B-001 | [Title] | Feature | Must | 5 | Ready | — |
| B-002 | [Title] | Bug | Should | 2 | Ready | — |
| B-003 | [Title] | Task | Could | 3 | New | — |

### Item Details

#### B-001: [Title]
- **Type**: Feature | Bug | Task | Spike | Tech Debt
- **Priority**: Must | Should | Could | Won't
- **Estimate**: [Points or size]
- **Status**: New | Ready | In Progress | Done | Cancelled
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
- **Notes**: [Context, links, dependencies]

#### B-002: [Title]
...
```

**Expected:** BACKLOG.md exists with valid structure and summary statistics.

**On failure:** If the file is malformed, restructure it preserving existing item data.

### Step 2: Write or Refine Items

For each new item, write it as a user story or requirement:

- **User story format**: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- **Requirement format**: "[System/Component] shall [behavior] when [condition]"

Each item must have:
- Unique ID (B-NNN, incrementing)
- Clear title (imperative verb form)
- Type classification
- At least 2 acceptance criteria (testable, binary pass/fail)

Example:
```markdown
#### B-005: Enable User Login with OAuth
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: Must
- **Estimate**: 5
- **Status**: Ready
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] User can log in using GitHub OAuth
  - [ ] User session persists for 24 hours
  - [ ] Failed login shows clear error message
- **Notes**: Requires OAuth app registration in GitHub
```

**Expected:** All items have titles, types, and acceptance criteria.

**On failure:** Items without acceptance criteria are marked Status: New (not Ready). They cannot enter a sprint.

### Step 3: Prioritize Using MoSCoW or Value/Effort

Apply the chosen prioritization framework:

**MoSCoW** (default):
- **Must**: Project fails without this. Non-negotiable.
- **Should**: Important but project can succeed without it. Include if capacity allows.
- **Could**: Nice to have. Include only if no impact on Must/Should items.
- **Won't**: Explicitly excluded from current scope. Documented for future consideration.

**Value/Effort Matrix** (alternative):

| | Low Effort | High Effort |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| **High Value** | Do First (Quick Wins) | Do Second (Big Bets) |
| **Low Value** | Do Third (Fill-ins) | Don't Do (Money Pits) |

Sort the backlog table: Must items first (by value within Must), then Should, then Could.

**Expected:** Every item has a priority. Backlog is sorted by priority.

**On failure:** If stakeholders disagree on priorities, escalate Must vs Should decisions to the project sponsor.

### Step 4: Groom — Split, Estimate, and Refine

Review items for sprint-readiness. For each item:
1. **Split** if estimate > 8 points (or > 1 week effort): decompose into 2-4 smaller items
2. **Estimate** using the project's chosen scale
3. **Refine** vague acceptance criteria into testable conditions
4. **Mark Ready** when the item has title, acceptance criteria, estimate, and no blockers

Document splitting:
```markdown
**Split**: B-003 split into B-003a, B-003b, B-003c (original archived)

#### B-003a: Set Up Database Schema
- **Type**: Task
- **Priority**: Must
- **Estimate**: 3
- **Status**: Ready
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Users table created with email, name fields
  - [ ] Migrations run successfully on dev environment

#### B-003b: Implement User CRUD Operations
- **Type**: Task
- **Priority**: Must
- **Estimate**: 5
- **Status**: Ready
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Create user endpoint returns 201 with user object
  - [ ] Update user endpoint validates required fields
```

**Expected:** All Must and Should items are in Ready status.

**On failure:** Items that can't be estimated need a Spike (time-boxed research task) added to the backlog.

### Step 5: Update Summary and Archive

Update the summary statistics. Move Done and Cancelled items to an archive section:

```markdown
### Archive
| ID | Title | Status | Sprint | Completed |
|----|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| B-001 | Enable User Login with OAuth | Done | S-003 | 2025-03-15 |
| B-004 | Add Dark Mode Theme | Cancelled | — | 2025-03-10 |
```

Update the summary by counting items in each status:
```bash
# Count Ready items
grep "| Ready |" BACKLOG.md | wc -l

# Count In Progress items
grep "| In Progress |" BACKLOG.md | wc -l

# Count Done items
grep "| Done |" BACKLOG.md | wc -l
```

**Expected:** Summary statistics match actual item counts. Archive section contains all closed items.

**On failure:** If counts don't match, recount by grepping Status values and update the summary manually.

## Validation

- [ ] BACKLOG.md exists with standard structure
- [ ] Every item has a unique ID, title, type, priority, and status
- [ ] All Must and Should items have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Items are sorted by priority (Must first, then Should, then Could)
- [ ] No item estimated at > 8 points without being split
- [ ] Summary statistics are accurate
- [ ] Done/Cancelled items are archived

## Common Pitfalls

- **No acceptance criteria**: Items without criteria can't be verified as done. Every item needs at least 2 testable criteria.
- **Everything is Must priority**: If >50% of items are Must, priorities are not real. Force-rank within Must.
- **Zombie items**: Items sitting in the backlog for months without progress should be re-evaluated or cancelled.
- **Estimates without context**: Story points are relative — a team must have a reference item (e.g., "B-001 is our 3-point reference").
- **Splitting creates fragments**: When splitting, ensure each child item is independently deliverable and valuable.
- **Backlog as dumping ground**: The backlog is not a wish list. Regularly prune items that no longer align with project goals.
- **Missing dependencies**: Note blocking items in the Notes field. A blocked item should not be marked Ready.
