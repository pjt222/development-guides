# Build Sequential Circuit

Design a sequential logic circuit by identifying the required memory and state type, constructing a state diagram and transition table, deriving excitation equations for the chosen flip-flop type, implementing the circuit at the gate level using flip-flops and combinational logic, and verifying correctness through timing diagram analysis and state sequence simulation.

## When to Use

- A circuit must remember past inputs or maintain internal state across clock cycles
- Designing counters (binary, BCD, ring, Johnson), shift registers, or sequence detectors
- Implementing a finite state machine (Mealy or Moore) from a state diagram or regular expression
- Adding clocked storage elements to a combinational datapath (registers, pipeline stages)
- Preparing stateful components for the simulate-cpu-architecture skill (register file, program counter, control FSM)

## Inputs

- **Required**: Behavioral specification -- one of: state diagram, state table, timing diagram, regular expression to detect, or verbal description of the desired sequential behavior
- **Required**: Clock characteristics -- edge-triggered (rising/falling) or level-sensitive; single clock or multi-phase
- **Optional**: Flip-flop type preference (D, JK, T, or SR)
- **Optional**: Reset type -- synchronous, asynchronous, or none
- **Optional**: Maximum state count or bit width constraint
- **Optional**: Timing constraints (setup time, hold time, maximum clock frequency)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Memory and State Requirements

Determine what the circuit needs to remember and how many distinct states it requires:

1. **State enumeration**: List all distinct states the circuit must be in. For a sequence detector, each state represents the progress through the target sequence. For a counter, each state is a count value.
2. **State encoding**: Choose a binary encoding for the states.
   - **Binary encoding**: Uses ceil(log2(N)) flip-flops for N states. Minimizes flip-flop count.
   - **One-hot encoding**: Uses N flip-flops, one per state. Simplifies next-state logic at the cost of more flip-flops.
   - **Gray code encoding**: Adjacent states differ in exactly one bit. Minimizes transient glitches during transitions.
3. **Input and output classification**: Identify primary inputs (external signals), primary outputs, and internal state variables (flip-flop outputs). For Mealy machines, outputs depend on both state and input. For Moore machines, outputs depend only on state.
4. **Flip-flop type selection**: Choose based on the design's needs.
   - **D flip-flop**: Simplest -- next state equals the D input. Best default choice.
   - **JK flip-flop**: Most flexible -- J=K=1 toggles. Good for counters.
   - **T flip-flop**: Toggle type -- changes state when T=1. Natural for binary counters.
   - **SR latch/flip-flop**: Set-Reset -- avoid the S=R=1 condition. Rarely preferred for new designs.

## State Requirements
- **Number of states**: [N]
- **State encoding**: [binary / one-hot / Gray]
- **Flip-flops needed**: [count and type]
- **Machine type**: [Mealy / Moore]
- **Inputs**: [list with descriptions]
- **Outputs**: [list with descriptions]
- **Reset behavior**: [synchronous / asynchronous / none]
```

**Expected:** A complete state inventory with encoding chosen, flip-flop type selected, and the machine classified as Mealy or Moore.

**On failure:** If the state count is unclear from the specification, enumerate states by tracing through all possible input sequences up to the memory depth of the circuit. If the count exceeds practical limits (more than 16 states for manual design), consider decomposing into smaller interacting FSMs.

### Step 2: Construct State Diagram and Transition Table

Formalize the circuit's behavior as a state diagram and equivalent tabular form:

1. **State diagram**: Draw a directed graph where:
   - Each node is a state, labeled with the state name and (for Moore machines) the output value.
   - Each edge is a transition, labeled with the input condition and (for Mealy machines) the output value.
   - Every state must have an outgoing edge for every possible input combination -- no implicit "stay" transitions.
2. **Transition table**: Convert the diagram to a table with columns for present state, input(s), next state, and output(s).
3. **Reachability check**: Starting from the initial/reset state, verify that all states are reachable through some input sequence. Unreachable states indicate a design error or should be treated as don't-cares.
4. **State minimization** (optional): Check for equivalent states -- two states are equivalent if they produce the same output for every input and transition to equivalent next states. Merge equivalent states to reduce flip-flop count.

## State Transition Table
| Present State | Input | Next State | Output |
|--------------|-------|------------|--------|
| S0           | 0     | S0         | 0      |
| S0           | 1     | S1         | 0      |
| S1           | 0     | S0         | 0      |
| S1           | 1     | S2         | 0      |
| ...          | ...   | ...        | ...    |

- **Unreachable states**: [list, or "none"]
- **Equivalent state pairs**: [list, or "none"]
```

**Expected:** A complete state transition table covering every present-state/input combination, with all states reachable from the initial state.

**On failure:** If the transition table has missing entries, the specification is incomplete. Return to the requirements and resolve the ambiguity. If unreachable states exist, either add transitions to reach them or remove them and reduce the state encoding.

### Step 3: Derive Excitation Equations

Compute the flip-flop input equations (excitation equations) from the transition table:

1. **Encode states**: Replace state names with their binary encoding in the transition table. Each bit position corresponds to one flip-flop.
2. **Build per-flip-flop truth table**: For each flip-flop, create a truth table with present-state bits and inputs as the input columns and the required flip-flop input as the output column.
   - **D flip-flop**: D = next state bit (the simplest case).
   - **JK flip-flop**: Use the excitation table: 0->0 requires J=0,K=X; 0->1 requires J=1,K=X; 1->0 requires J=X,K=1; 1->1 requires J=X,K=0.
   - **T flip-flop**: T = present state XOR next state (T=1 when the bit must change).
3. **Minimize each equation**: Apply evaluate-boolean-expression (K-map or algebraic simplification) to each flip-flop input function. Don't-care conditions from unreachable states and JK excitation table X-entries can reduce the expressions significantly.
4. **Derive output equations**: For Moore machines, express each output as a function of present state bits only. For Mealy machines, express each output as a function of present state bits and inputs.

```markdown
## Excitation Equations
- **Flip-flop type**: [D / JK / T]
- **State encoding**: [binary assignment table]

| Flip-Flop | Excitation Equation          |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Q1        | D1 = [minimized expression]  |
| Q0        | D0 = [minimized expression]  |

## Output Equations
| Output | Equation                     |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Y      | [minimized expression]       |
```

**Expected:** Minimized excitation equations for each flip-flop and output equations for each primary output, with all don't-cares exploited.

**On failure:** If the excitation equations seem overly complex, reconsider the state encoding. A different encoding (e.g., switching from binary to one-hot, or reassigning state codes) can dramatically simplify the combinational logic. Try at least two encodings and compare literal counts.

### Step 4: Implement at Gate Level

Build the complete circuit from flip-flops and combinational logic gates:

1. **Place flip-flops**: Instantiate one flip-flop per state bit. Connect all clock inputs to the system clock. Connect reset inputs if specified (asynchronous reset goes directly to the flip-flop's CLR/PRE pin; synchronous reset is part of the excitation logic).
2. **Build excitation logic**: Implement each excitation equation as a combinational circuit using the design-logic-circuit skill. The inputs to this logic are the present-state flip-flop outputs (Q, Q') and primary inputs.
3. **Build output logic**: Implement each output equation as combinational logic. For Moore machines, this logic takes only state bits. For Mealy machines, it takes state bits and primary inputs.
4. **Connect the circuit**: Wire the excitation logic outputs to the flip-flop D/JK/T inputs. Wire the output logic to the primary outputs.
5. **Add initialization**: Ensure the circuit reaches a known initial state on power-up. This typically means an asynchronous reset that forces all flip-flops to 0 (or the encoded initial state).

```markdown
## Circuit Implementation
- **Flip-flops**: [count] x [type], [edge type]-triggered
- **Combinational gates for excitation**: [count and types]
- **Combinational gates for output**: [count and types]
- **Total gate count**: [flip-flops + combinational gates]
- **Reset mechanism**: [asynchronous CLR / synchronous mux / none]
```

**Expected:** A complete gate-level netlist with flip-flops, excitation logic, output logic, clock distribution, and reset mechanism, where every signal has exactly one driver.

**On failure:** If the implementation has feedback outside of the flip-flops, a combinational loop has been introduced. All feedback in a synchronous sequential circuit must pass through a flip-flop. Trace the offending path and reroute it through a register.

### Step 5: Verify via Timing Diagram and State Sequence Simulation

Confirm the circuit behaves correctly across multiple clock cycles:

1. **Choose test sequence**: Select an input sequence that exercises every state transition at least once. For sequence detectors, include the target sequence, partial matches, overlapping matches, and non-matching runs.
2. **Draw timing diagram**: For each clock cycle, record:
   - Clock edge (rising/falling)
   - Primary input values (sampled at the active clock edge)
   - Present state (flip-flop outputs before the clock edge)
   - Next state (flip-flop outputs after the clock edge)
   - Output values (valid after the output logic settles)
3. **Trace state sequence**: Verify that the sequence of states matches the state diagram from Step 2. Every transition should follow an edge in the diagram.
4. **Check timing constraints**: Verify that:
   - **Setup time**: Inputs are stable for at least t_setup before the active clock edge.
   - **Hold time**: Inputs remain stable for at least t_hold after the active clock edge.
   - **Clock-to-output delay**: Outputs settle within the clock period minus the setup time of downstream logic.
5. **Reset verification**: Confirm that applying reset drives the circuit to the initial state regardless of the current state.

## Timing Verification
| Cycle | Clock | Input | Present State | Next State | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|------------|--------|
| 0     | rst   | -     | -             | S0         | 0      |
| 1     | rise  | 1     | S0            | S1         | 0      |
| 2     | rise  | 1     | S1            | S2         | 0      |
| ...   | ...   | ...   | ...           | ...        | ...    |

- **All transitions match state diagram**: [Yes / No]
- **Setup/hold violations**: [None / list]
- **Reset verified**: [Yes / No]
```

**Expected:** Every cycle in the timing diagram matches the state transition table, outputs are correct for every cycle, and no timing violations are present.

**On failure:** If a state transition is wrong, trace the excitation logic for that specific present-state and input combination. If outputs are wrong but transitions are correct, the error is in the output logic. If the circuit enters an unintended state, check for incomplete reset or missing transitions from unused state codes.

- [ ] Transition table covers every present-state/input combination
- [ ] Excitation equations are minimized with don't-cares exploited
- [ ] Output equations correctly implement Mealy or Moore semantics
- [ ] Every flip-flop has clock, reset, and excitation inputs connected
- [ ] No combinational feedback loops exist outside of flip-flops
- [ ] Timing diagram covers all state transitions at least once
- [ ] Reset drives the circuit to the documented initial state
- [ ] Setup and hold time constraints are satisfied

## Common Pitfalls

- **Incomplete state transitions**: Forgetting to specify what happens for every input in every state. Missing transitions often cause the circuit to enter an undefined or unintended state. Always define behavior for all input combinations.
- **Unused state codes**: With N flip-flops, there are 2^N possible codes but perhaps fewer valid states. If the circuit accidentally enters an unused code (due to noise or power-on), it may lock up. Always add transitions from unused codes to the reset state or prove they are unreachable.
- **Confusing Mealy and Moore outputs**: In a Mealy machine, outputs change immediately when inputs change (combinational path from input to output). In a Moore machine, outputs change only on clock edges. Mixing the two models in one design leads to timing hazards.
- **Asynchronous inputs to synchronous circuits**: External signals not synchronized to the clock can violate setup/hold times, causing metastability. Always pass asynchronous inputs through a two-flip-flop synchronizer before using them in state logic.
- **SR latch S=R=1 hazard**: Driving both Set and Reset high simultaneously puts the SR latch in an undefined state. If using SR elements, add logic to guarantee this combination never occurs, or switch to D or JK flip-flops.
- **Clock skew in multi-flip-flop designs**: If the clock arrives at different flip-flops at different times, one flip-flop may sample stale data from another. For introductory designs, assume zero skew; for real hardware, use clock tree synthesis.
