# Practice Aikido

Develop an aikido practice rooted in centering, blending with incoming force, and resolving conflict through controlled technique rather than opposing strength with strength.

## When to Use

- Learning a defensive martial art that prioritizes de-escalation and controlled resolution
- Developing the ability to redirect aggression without causing unnecessary harm
- Building safe falling skills (ukemi) applicable to any physical activity or emergency
- Cultivating calm centeredness under physical pressure or confrontation
- Complementing tai chi or meditation with a partner-based martial practice (see `tai-chi`, `meditate`)
- Training awareness and response to multiple simultaneous threats

## Inputs

- **Required**: Practice space with a padded or yielding surface (tatami, judo mats, grass; avoid concrete)
- **Required**: Comfortable clothing allowing full range of motion (gi preferred; loose exercise clothing acceptable)
- **Optional**: Training partner (essential for techniques; solo practice covers centering, ukemi, and movement)
- **Optional**: Practice weapons (wooden: jo staff ~128cm, bokken sword ~102cm, tanto knife ~30cm)
- **Optional**: Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced; default: beginner)
- **Optional**: Available practice time (minimum 20 minutes; recommended 60-90 minutes)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Ground and Center

Every aikido technique begins from a centered state. Without center, technique becomes muscular struggle.

1. Stand in hanmi (half-facing stance): one foot forward, feet roughly shoulder-width apart at 60-degree angle
2. Bend knees slightly — weight sinks toward the one-point (seika tanden), located 5cm below the navel
3. Relax the shoulders completely — let them drop away from the ears
4. Extend awareness outward while keeping attention anchored at the one-point
5. Test your center: have a partner push gently on your chest
   - If you resist with upper body, you are not centered — relax and sink lower
   - If you maintain stability without effort, center is established
6. Practice weight underside: imagine that the heavy part of each arm is the underside; let the upper surface feel light and buoyant
7. Extend ki: project calm, positive energy forward through the fingertips — not tension, but focused intention

**Expected:** A stable, relaxed stance where pushes are absorbed through the structure into the ground rather than resisted by muscles. A quiet mind with broad awareness.

**On failure:** If the stance feels rigid, you are holding tension. Shake out the arms and legs, take 5 deep breaths, and re-establish from scratch. If pushes easily displace you, lower your center of gravity (bend knees more) and focus on the one-point. Centering is a skill that deepens over months — initial wobbliness is normal.

### Step 2: Master Ukemi (Falling and Rolling)

Ukemi is the art of receiving technique safely. It is the most important skill in aikido — you will fall thousands of times.

```
Ukemi Progression:
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│ Level              │ Technique                │ Practice Method            │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Backward fall   │ Sit down, roll back,     │ From seated, then squat,  │
│ (ushiro ukemi)     │ slap mat with both arms  │ then standing. Chin to    │
│                    │ at 45 degrees            │ chest — never hit head    │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Side fall       │ Fall to the side, arm    │ From kneeling, then       │
│ (yoko ukemi)       │ slaps mat, body in arc   │ standing. Land on the     │
│                    │ — not flat on the back   │ fleshy side, not hip bone │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Forward roll    │ Roll diagonally over     │ From kneeling, then       │
│ (mae ukemi)        │ shoulder: hand-forearm-  │ standing, then moving.    │
│                    │ shoulder-opposite hip    │ The line is diagonal,     │
│                    │                          │ never straight over spine │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Breakfall       │ High fall received with  │ Only after forward roll   │
│ (tobi ukemi)       │ a slap and roll at speed │ is completely smooth.     │
│                    │                          │ Build height gradually    │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

Key principles:
1. The slap absorbs impact by spreading force across the arm surface — time it to land just before the body
2. Tuck the chin on every fall — the head never contacts the ground
3. Exhale on impact; holding the breath creates rigidity and increases injury risk
4. Forward rolls should be round and smooth — if there are thuds or flat spots, the body is not curved enough
5. Practice both sides: right shoulder forward and left shoulder forward

**Expected:** After 2-3 months of regular practice, forward rolls are smooth and quiet on both sides. Backward falls are automatic (no fear response). You can be thrown at moderate speed without hesitation.

**On failure:** If forward rolls cause shoulder pain, the angle is likely too steep (going over the top of the shoulder instead of across the back diagonally). Have a partner or instructor check the line. If fear prevents commitment to the roll, return to the kneeling version and build up gradually. Never force a breakfall before the forward roll is second nature.

### Step 3: Practice Basic Techniques

The four foundational techniques address the most common attack scenarios and embody aikido's core principles.

```
Technique Selection by Attack:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Attack          │ Technique        │ Principle                            │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Straight strike │ Irimi-nage       │ Enter behind the attack line, lead   │
│ (shomen-uchi)   │ (entering throw) │ attacker's head in a spiral, project │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Diagonal strike │ Shiho-nage       │ Redirect the attacking arm overhead  │
│ (yokomen-uchi)  │ (four-direction  │ in a spiral, control the wrist, cut  │
│                 │ throw)           │ down to throw in any direction       │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Wrist grab      │ Kote-gaeshi      │ Blend with the grab energy, apply    │
│ (katate-dori)   │ (wrist turn)     │ outward wrist rotation to unbalance  │
│                 │                  │ and project the attacker             │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Lapel/shoulder  │ Ikkyo            │ Control the elbow and wrist, pin     │
│ grab (ai-hanmi) │ (first teaching) │ the arm to the ground. Foundation    │
│                 │                  │ for all immobilizations              │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For each technique:
1. Begin with the attack at slow, cooperative speed
2. Blend first: move your body off the attack line (never block head-on)
3. Connect: make contact with the attacker's arm or body to feel their balance
4. Redirect: use circular motion to guide the attacker's energy into the technique
5. Complete: throw or pin with control — the goal is to end the encounter, not to injure
6. Practice 10-20 repetitions per side, alternating roles (nage/tori throws, uke attacks and falls)
7. Gradually increase speed and resistance as both partners gain proficiency

**Expected:** Techniques feel smooth and circular. The attacker is led rather than forced. At cooperative speed, both partners finish the exchange safely and without strain.

**On failure:** If a technique requires significant muscular effort, the blending is incomplete — the defender is fighting the attack instead of redirecting it. Return to the moment of contact and practice the initial blend in isolation. If the attacker feels yanked or wrenched, slow down and focus on leading with the center, not pulling with the hands.

### Step 4: Develop Blending (Tai Sabaki)

Tai sabaki — body movement — is the engine of aikido. Technique without movement is just wrestling.

1. **Irimi (entering)**: Step directly forward and past the attacker, moving inside their reach
   - Practice: partner extends a punch; step past it so you end behind their shoulder
2. **Tenkan (turning)**: Pivot 180 degrees on the front foot, redirecting the attacker's line
   - Practice: partner grabs your wrist; pivot smoothly so you face the same direction they do
3. **Irimi-tenkan (enter and turn)**: Combine entering with a pivot — the most common movement
   - Practice: enter past the attack, then pivot to control the attacker from behind
4. **Kaiten (rotation)**: Full body rotation to generate circular force for throws
   - Practice: combined with shiho-nage and other rotational techniques
5. Practice all movements solo first: step-pivot, step-pivot, step-pivot across the mat
6. Then with a partner: focus on matching timing to the attack — move as they commit, not before or after

**Expected:** Movement is fluid, centered, and timed to the attack. The defender is never squared up facing the attack force — always angled off the line.

**On failure:** If timing is off (arriving too early or too late), practice with a very slow, telegraphed attack. The defender should move at the same moment the attack commits — this is the "aiki" timing. If turns feel clumsy, practice tenkan as a standalone drill: 100 pivots per session builds smooth, automatic rotation.

### Step 5: Train Randori (Multiple Attackers)

Randori develops the awareness and decisiveness needed when overwhelmed. It is where principles are truly tested.

1. Begin with two attackers at slow speed — they take turns (not simultaneous)
2. Core principle: never stop moving. Stationary means surrounded
3. Use each attacker as a shield against the others: redirect one into the path of another
4. Move to open space — never back into a corner or wall
5. Extend awareness in all directions; do not fixate on one attacker (see `mindfulness`)
6. Apply simple, reliable techniques — complex techniques fail under pressure
7. Progress to three attackers, then four, increasing speed gradually
8. Randori is not about defeating every attacker — it is about maintaining center and freedom of movement

**Expected:** The ability to stay calm and mobile while being approached from multiple angles. Techniques are applied fluidly without freezing or tunnel vision.

**On failure:** If panic sets in, return to two slow attackers. Randori anxiety is normal and decreases with exposure. If techniques collapse under pressure, simplify: focus on irimi (entering) and tenkan (turning) only, ignoring throws entirely. Movement and positioning are more important than technique execution in randori.

### Step 6: Integrate Weapons Awareness

Weapons training deepens understanding of distance, timing, and line — principles that improve empty-hand technique.

1. **Jo (staff)**: Practice 31-count jo kata for line and extension
   - The jo teaches maintaining distance and controlling space
   - Partner practice: jo-dori (staff taking) — disarm a staff attack with empty hands
2. **Bokken (wooden sword)**: Practice suburi (cutting exercises) for precision and center line awareness
   - The sword teaches commitment: every cut must follow a precise line
   - Partner practice: kumitachi (paired sword forms) for timing and distance
3. **Tanto (wooden knife)**: Practice tanto-dori (knife defense)
   - The knife teaches respect for close-range danger
   - Always redirect the weapon hand — never reach for the blade
4. Weapons principles that transfer to empty-hand:
   - Ma-ai (proper distance): too close invites the weapon; too far wastes the response
   - Shomen (center line): all attacks and defenses relate to the vertical center line
   - Zanshin (continuing awareness): remain alert after the technique completes

**Expected:** Weapons practice clarifies why tai sabaki, timing, and distance matter. Empty-hand technique improves as body movement becomes more precise.

**On failure:** If weapons feel awkward or disconnected from empty-hand practice, focus on suburi (solo cutting exercises) for one month before adding partner work. If a partner practice becomes competitive or dangerous, slow down immediately — wooden weapons can cause real injury at speed.

### Step 7: Apply Principles Off the Mat

Aikido's value extends beyond the dojo into daily interaction and conflict resolution.

1. In confrontation, apply irimi-tenkan mentally: move toward the person's concern (enter), then redirect the conversation to common ground (turn)
2. In physical space, maintain awareness of position, exits, and others' body language (see `mindfulness`)
3. Practice "receiving" criticism or aggression without resistance — acknowledge the energy, then redirect
4. Cultivate the habit of centering before stressful situations: drop awareness to the one-point, relax shoulders, extend calm intention
5. Regular practice schedule:
   - Solo (daily, 15-30 min): centering, ukemi rolls, tai sabaki, weapons suburi
   - Partner (2-3x weekly, 60-90 min): techniques, randori, weapons partner work
6. Complement with tai chi for internal energy development (see `tai-chi`)
7. Complement with meditation for mental stillness and equanimity (see `meditate`)

**Expected:** Aikido principles — blending, redirecting, centering — become natural responses to conflict in daily life. Physical practice maintains and deepens martial skill.

**On failure:** If daily practice lapses, focus on the smallest unit: 5 minutes of centering and 20 forward rolls. Consistency matters more than duration. If the martial aspects feel disconnected from daily life, reflect on how each technique is a metaphor: irimi is facing a problem directly; tenkan is changing perspective; ukemi is recovering from setbacks.

## Validation

- [ ] Centered stance absorbs moderate pushes without muscular resistance
- [ ] Forward rolls are smooth, quiet, and practiced on both sides
- [ ] At least four basic techniques can be performed cooperatively with a partner
- [ ] Tai sabaki (irimi, tenkan, irimi-tenkan) is practiced both solo and with a partner
- [ ] Randori with two slow attackers can be sustained for 60 seconds without freezing
- [ ] At least one weapon (jo, bokken, or tanto) has been practiced in solo kata
- [ ] Practice includes both solo and partner components regularly

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using muscle instead of blending**: If a technique requires strength, the timing or angle is wrong. Relax, re-enter, and let the attacker's energy do the work. Aikido's power comes from redirecting force, not generating it
- **Neglecting ukemi**: Students who avoid falling avoid learning. Ukemi IS aikido — the ability to receive force safely. Practice it every session, especially at the start
- **Fear of commitment**: Half-hearted entering (irimi) puts you in the worst position — too close to evade, too far to control. Once you decide to enter, commit fully to moving past the attack
- **Fixating on one attacker**: In randori and in life, tunnel vision is dangerous. Keep soft, wide awareness. Peripheral vision detects motion before focused vision does
- **Training only with compliant partners**: While beginners need cooperation, intermediate students should gradually increase resistance. Technique that only works on a cooperative partner is incomplete
