# Detect Anomalies for AIOps


> See [Extended Examples](references/EXAMPLES.md) for complete configuration files and templates.

Apply machine learning to detect anomalies in operational metrics, correlate alerts, and reduce false positives.

## When to Use

- Operations team overwhelmed by alert volume (>100 alerts/day)
- Need to detect complex multi-metric anomalies (not just threshold breaches)
- Seasonal patterns make static thresholds ineffective
- Want to predict issues before they impact users (proactive detection)
- Need to correlate related alerts to identify root cause
- Monitoring system generates too many false positives
- Want to detect subtle performance degradation trends

## Inputs

- **Required**: Time series metrics from monitoring system (CPU, memory, latency, error rate)
- **Required**: Historical data (30-90 days minimum)
- **Optional**: Alert history with labels (true positive / false positive)
- **Optional**: System topology (service dependencies)
- **Optional**: Log data for correlation
- **Optional**: Deployment/change events for context

## Procedure

### Step 1: Set Up Environment and Load Data

Install dependencies and prepare time series data for analysis.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install anomaly detection libraries
pip install prophet scikit-learn pandas numpy
pip install tensorflow keras  # for LSTM models
pip install pyod  # Python Outlier Detection library
pip install statsmodels  # for statistical methods
pip install prometheus-api-client  # if using Prometheus

# Visualization
pip install plotly matplotlib seaborn
```

Load and prepare data:

```python
# aiops/data_loader.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List, Dict
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** Time series data loaded with regular intervals, missing values handled, features engineered for ML models.

**On failure:** If Prometheus connection fails, verify URL and network access, if data gaps exist use forward-fill or interpolation, ensure timestamp column is datetime type, check for memory issues with large date ranges (process in chunks).

### Step 2: Implement Isolation Forest for Multivariate Anomaly Detection

Detect anomalies using unsupervised Isolation Forest algorithm.

```python
# aiops/isolation_forest_detector.py
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from typing import Dict, List
import joblib

# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** Model trained on historical data, anomalies detected with scores, typically 0.5-2% of points flagged as anomalies.

**On failure:** If too many anomalies (>5%), reduce contamination parameter or retrain on cleaner baseline period, if too few (<0.1%), increase contamination or check feature scaling, verify features have sufficient variance.

### Step 3: Implement Prophet for Time Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection

Use Facebook Prophet to model seasonality and detect deviations.

```python
# aiops/prophet_detector.py
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from typing import Dict, Tuple
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** Prophet models capture daily/weekly seasonality, anomalies detected when actual values fall outside 99% confidence interval, forecasts generated for capacity planning.

**On failure:** If Prophet takes too long (>5 min per metric), reduce history to 30 days or disable weekly_seasonality, if too many false positives increase interval_width to 0.995, if missing seasonal patterns add custom seasonalities, ensure timezone consistency in timestamps.

### Step 4: Correlate Alerts and Identify Root Cause

Group related anomalies and identify potential root causes.

```python
# aiops/alert_correlation.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from typing import List, Dict
from datetime import timedelta
import networkx as nx

# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** Related anomalies grouped into incidents, root causes identified based on dependency graph, incident summaries generated for investigation.

**On failure:** If all anomalies separate incidents, increase time_window_minutes, if root cause detection unclear define metric_relationships explicitly based on architecture, verify timestamp sorting is correct.

### Step 5: Integrate with Alerting System

Send intelligent alerts with context and suppression of noise.

```python
# aiops/intelligent_alerting.py
import requests
import logging
from typing import Dict, List
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import json

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** High-severity incidents trigger PagerDuty pages, medium-severity go to Slack, low-severity logged only, duplicate alerts suppressed within 15-minute window.

**On failure:** Test webhook URLs with curl first, verify severity calculation produces reasonable values (0.5-0.9 range), check rate limiting doesn't suppress all alerts, ensure timezone handling is correct for last_alerts tracking.

### Step 6: Deploy as Continuous Monitoring Service

Set up automated pipeline that runs periodically.

```python
# aiops/monitoring_service.py
import schedule
import time
import logging
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from data_loader import MetricsDataLoader
from isolation_forest_detector import IsolationForestDetector
from prophet_detector import ProphetAnomalyDetector
# ... (see EXAMPLES.md for complete implementation)
```

**Expected:** Service runs continuously, detects anomalies every 5 minutes, alerts sent for incidents, logs all activity.

**On failure:** Verify scheduler process stays alive (use systemd/supervisor for production), check Prometheus connectivity, ensure models are loaded successfully, implement dead man's switch alert if service stops running, monitor memory usage (reload models periodically if memory grows).

## Validation

- [ ] Historical data loaded correctly with no missing timestamps
- [ ] Isolation Forest detects known anomalies from test set
- [ ] Prophet models capture daily/weekly seasonality in visualizations
- [ ] Alert correlation groups temporally-related anomalies
- [ ] Root cause detection identifies upstream issues correctly
- [ ] Intelligent alerting suppresses duplicate alerts
- [ ] Severity calculation produces reasonable scores (0.5-0.9)
- [ ] Monitoring service runs continuously without crashes for 7+ days
- [ ] False positive rate < 10% (validated against labeled data)
- [ ] True positive rate > 80% for critical incidents

## Common Pitfalls

- **Training on anomalous data**: Ensure baseline period used for training is clean (no incidents); manually review or use labeled data
- **Ignoring seasonality**: Static models fail on daily/weekly patterns; use Prophet or add time features
- **Too sensitive thresholds**: 99% confidence intervals may flag normal peaks; start with 99.5% and tune based on false positives
- **Not handling missing data**: Gaps in metrics cause model errors; implement robust preprocessing with interpolation
- **Alert fatigue from low severity**: Filter alerts below severity threshold; focus on high-confidence anomalies
- **Ignoring system topology**: Treating all metrics independently misses cascading failures; define dependency relationships
- **Model drift**: Models trained on old data become stale; retrain monthly or when system changes
- **Resource contention**: Running detection on every metric is expensive; prioritize critical services or sample metrics
