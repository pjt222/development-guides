# Forage Plants

Identify and safely gather edible and useful wild plants in wilderness settings.

## When to Use

- You need to supplement food supply in a wilderness or survival setting
- You need medicinal or utility plants (cordage, tinder, insect repellent)
- You want to identify plants around camp for safety (avoid toxic species)
- Long-term wilderness scenario where foraging extends available rations

## Inputs

- **Required**: A habitat to forage in (forest, meadow, wetland, shoreline)
- **Required**: Ability to observe fine plant details (leaf shape, arrangement, flower structure)
- **Optional**: Field guide or reference material for the region
- **Optional**: Container for collected plants
- **Optional**: Knife for harvesting
- **Optional**: Fire and water for preparation (see `make-fire`, `purify-water`)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Know the Deadly Plants First

Before learning what to eat, learn what will kill you. Memorize these high-risk families and species for your region.

```
Critical "Never Eat" Plants (Northern Hemisphere):
┌─────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ Plant               │ Key Identification             │ Danger              │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Water hemlock       │ Hollow, chambered stem base;   │ Deadly in minutes.  │
│ (Cicuta)            │ smells like carrot/parsnip;    │ Seizures, death.    │
│                     │ wet habitats; compound leaves  │ No safe dose.       │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Poison hemlock      │ Smooth stem with purple        │ Deadly. Ascending   │
│ (Conium maculatum)  │ blotches; musty smell;         │ paralysis.          │
│                     │ finely divided leaves          │                     │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Destroying angel /  │ White mushroom; white gills;   │ Deadly (liver       │
│ Death cap (Amanita) │ ring on stem; cup (volva)      │ failure in 3-5      │
│                     │ at base; grows near trees      │ days). No antidote. │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Castor bean         │ Large star-shaped leaves;      │ Seeds contain ricin. │
│ (Ricinus communis)  │ spiny seed pods                │ Deadly if chewed.   │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Foxglove            │ Tall spike of tubular flowers; │ Cardiac glycosides. │
│ (Digitalis)         │ fuzzy, wrinkled leaves         │ Heart failure.      │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ Nightshade family   │ Some edible (tomato, pepper),  │ Berries and foliage │
│ (Solanum, Atropa)   │ many toxic; 5-petaled flowers; │ of wild species can │
│                     │ alternate leaves               │ be lethal.          │
└─────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

Absolute Rules:
1. NEVER eat a plant you cannot positively identify
2. NEVER eat white or red berries unless specifically identified as safe
3. NEVER eat mushrooms in a survival situation unless expert-level confident
4. NEVER eat plants with milky or discolored sap (exceptions exist but require expertise)
5. NEVER eat plants from the carrot/parsley family (Apiaceae) unless certain — this family contains the deadliest plants alongside the most common herbs
```

**Expected:** You can recognize the most dangerous plants in your region on sight and will not confuse them with edible species.

**On failure:** If unsure about any plant in these families, do not eat it. The cost of a false positive (eating a deadly plant) is death. The cost of a false negative (skipping a safe plant) is a missed meal. Always err toward caution.

### Step 2: Read the Habitat

Different habitats produce different resources. Survey the area before collecting.

```
Habitat-to-Resource Mapping:
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Habitat          │ Common Edible Plants        │ Look for                 │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Open meadow /    │ Dandelion, clover, plantain,│ Sunny, disturbed ground  │
│ field edges      │ chicory, wild onion,        │ with diverse low plants  │
│                  │ lamb's quarters             │                          │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Forest floor     │ Wood sorrel, ramps (spring),│ Dappled shade; look near │
│                  │ violets, fiddleheads (spring│ logs and clearings       │
│                  │ only), nuts (fall)          │                          │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Forest edge /    │ Berries (blackberry,        │ Transitional zone with   │
│ hedgerow         │ raspberry, elderberry),     │ maximum species diversity │
│                  │ rose hips, hawthorn         │                          │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Wetland / stream │ Cattail, watercress,        │ Moist soil, standing or  │
│ bank             │ wild rice, arrowhead        │ slow water               │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Shoreline /      │ Seaweed (kelp, dulse, nori),│ Rocky intertidal zones,  │
│ coastal          │ sea lettuce, glasswort      │ salt marshes             │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Disturbed ground │ Lamb's quarters, amaranth,  │ Trailsides, old fields, │
│ (ruderal)        │ purslane, chickweed,        │ roadsides (avoid        │
│                  │ stinging nettle             │ herbicide areas)        │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

**Expected:** You identify which habitat type you are in and have a shortlist of likely edible species to look for.

**On failure:** If the habitat is unfamiliar or plant diversity is low (dense conifer forest, desert), focus on the universal species in Step 8. In arid environments, look for cacti pads (Opuntia), mesquite pods, or acorns from oaks. In deep forest, look for inner bark (cambium) of pine, birch, or basswood as emergency calories.

### Step 3: Identify Using Multiple Features

Never identify a plant by a single feature. Use the multi-feature method.

```
Identification Checklist — Confirm ALL of the following:

1. LEAF SHAPE AND MARGIN
   - Simple or compound?
   - Smooth, toothed, or lobed?
   - Pointed or rounded?

2. LEAF ARRANGEMENT
   - Alternate, opposite, or whorled on the stem?
   - Basal rosette?

3. STEM CHARACTERISTICS
   - Round, square, or ridged?
   - Hollow or solid?
   - Hairy, smooth, or thorny?

4. FLOWER STRUCTURE (if present)
   - Number of petals
   - Color
   - Symmetry (radial or bilateral)
   - Arrangement (spike, cluster, umbel, single)

5. SMELL
   - Crush a leaf: minty, oniony, bitter, no scent?
   - Some families have distinctive smells (mint = square stem + aromatic)

6. HABITAT AND SEASON
   - Where is it growing? (wet, dry, sun, shade)
   - What time of year? (confirms seasonal species)

7. ROOT/RHIZOME (dig one sample)
   - Bulb, taproot, fibrous, or rhizome?
   - Color and smell of the root

Rule: You need a match on ALL features, not just some.
      A single mismatch means you have the wrong plant.
```

**Expected:** Positive identification based on at least 5 matching features. You can name the species and explain why it is not a dangerous look-alike.

**On failure:** If any feature does not match your reference, do not eat the plant. Set it aside and move to another candidate. Look-alikes are the primary cause of foraging poisoning — wild carrot (edible) vs. poison hemlock (deadly) differ in stem markings and smell but share leaf shape.

### Step 4: Apply the Universal Edibility Test (Emergency Only)

This test is a last resort for completely unknown plants when you have no reference material and are facing starvation. It takes 24+ hours and carries risk.

```
Universal Edibility Test Protocol:
(Only use when: no field guide, no known species, genuinely starving)

1. SEPARATE the plant into parts: leaves, stems, roots, flowers, seeds
   (each part must be tested independently)

2. SMELL the plant part — reject if strongly bitter or acrid

3. SKIN CONTACT: rub the plant part on inner wrist
   Wait 15 minutes — reject if burning, rash, or numbness

4. LIP TEST: touch plant part to corner of lip
   Wait 15 minutes — reject if burning, tingling, or numbness

5. TONGUE TEST: place on tongue, do not chew
   Wait 15 minutes — reject if unpleasant reaction

6. CHEW TEST: chew and hold in mouth, do not swallow
   Wait 15 minutes — reject if bitter, soapy, burning

7. SWALLOW TEST: swallow a small amount (teaspoon)
   Wait 8 hours — eat nothing else during this time
   Reject if nausea, cramps, diarrhea, or any ill effect

8. If no reaction after 8 hours: eat a small handful
   Wait another 8 hours
   If still no reaction: the plant part is likely safe

CRITICAL WARNINGS:
- Test ONLY ONE plant part at a time
- Do NOT test mushrooms with this method (toxins can be delayed 24-72 hrs)
- Do NOT test plants with milky sap
- Stay hydrated throughout the test
- This test does NOT detect all toxins (cumulative toxins, carcinogens)
```

**Expected:** After the full test protocol, you have a tentative edible plant, though with less certainty than a positive ID.

**On failure:** If any reaction occurs at any stage, spit out or induce vomiting if swallowed. Drink water. Do not re-test the same plant. Move to a different species. If vomiting or diarrhea occur, focus on hydration and rest before resuming the test with another plant.

### Step 5: Harvest Sustainably

Take only what you need and preserve the plant population.

```
Sustainable Harvesting Rules:
1. Never take more than 1/3 of any plant stand
2. Never pull entire plants when leaves or fruits will do
3. Cut cleanly with a knife rather than tearing
4. Spread harvesting across a wide area
5. Leave root systems intact for perennials
6. Never harvest rare or protected species
7. Avoid plants near roads (exhaust contamination),
   agricultural fields (pesticides), or industrial areas

Harvest by Plant Part:
┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Plant Part   │ Harvest Method                                │
├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Leaves       │ Pick individual leaves; leave at least 2/3    │
│              │ of the plant's foliage                        │
├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Roots/tubers │ Dig carefully; replant any root crown or      │
│              │ small tubers to regenerate                    │
├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Berries/fruit│ Pick ripe fruit only; leave some for wildlife │
│              │ and seed dispersal                            │
├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bark/cambium │ Only harvest from downed or already damaged   │
│              │ trees; never ring-bark a living tree          │
├──────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Seeds/nuts   │ Collect from the ground when possible;        │
│              │ leave enough for wildlife and regeneration    │
└──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Expected:** A reasonable quantity of positively identified plant material, harvested without destroying the source population.

**On failure:** If the plant stand is too small (fewer than 10 individuals), take only a token sample or find a larger population elsewhere. Overharvesting in a survival situation is understandable, but in short-term scenarios, conservation ensures the resource is available in coming days.

### Step 6: Prepare for Consumption

Many edible wild plants benefit from or require preparation.

```
Preparation Methods:
┌──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Method       │ When to Use                  │ How                      │
├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Raw          │ Known-safe species like       │ Wash in purified water;  │
│              │ dandelion, wood sorrel, most  │ eat fresh               │
│              │ berries, watercress           │                          │
├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Boiled       │ Reduces bitterness, breaks   │ Boil 5-15 min; discard  │
│              │ down mild toxins; required    │ water for bitter plants  │
│              │ for nettle, dock, fiddleheads │ (leaching)              │
├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Double-boiled│ Plants with significant      │ Boil 10 min, discard    │
│ (leached)    │ oxalates or tannins (acorns, │ water; boil again in    │
│              │ dock)                        │ fresh water              │
├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Roasted      │ Roots, tubers, seeds, nuts   │ Place in coals or near  │
│              │                              │ fire; cook until soft    │
│              │                              │ or dry                   │
├──────────────┼──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Dried        │ Preservation for later use;  │ Air dry in sun/wind or  │
│              │ concentrates calories in      │ near fire (not in       │
│              │ seeds and roots              │ direct flame)            │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘

Key Preparation Rules:
- Always wash plants in purified water before eating
- Cook any plant from wet or contaminated habitats
- Boil stinging nettle for 2+ minutes to neutralize stinging hairs
- Boil fiddlehead ferns thoroughly (raw fiddleheads are mildly toxic)
- Leach acorns in multiple changes of water until bitterness is gone
```

**Expected:** Plant material is clean, prepared appropriately for the species, and ready to eat.

**On failure:** If you have no fire for cooking (see `make-fire`), limit foraging to species safe to eat raw. If taste is extremely bitter after preparation, the plant may contain high levels of tannins or alkaloids — do not force yourself to eat it. Discard and try another species.

### Step 7: Monitor for Reactions

Even correctly identified plants can cause individual reactions.

```
Reaction Monitoring Protocol:
1. Eat a small quantity first (a few leaves or one berry)
2. Wait 1-2 hours before eating more
3. Watch for:
   - Nausea or stomach cramps → stop eating, drink water
   - Tingling or numbness in mouth → spit out, rinse mouth
   - Skin rash or hives → possible contact allergy
   - Diarrhea → stop eating, focus on hydration
   - Dizziness or vision changes → possible toxic reaction,
     seek help immediately

If a reaction occurs:
- Stop eating the plant immediately
- Drink large amounts of water
- If severe (difficulty breathing, confusion), this is a medical emergency
- Note which plant and which part caused the reaction
- Do not re-eat that plant
```

**Expected:** No adverse reaction after 1-2 hours. You can then eat a normal portion.

**On failure:** If a mild reaction occurs (stomach discomfort, mild nausea), stop eating the plant, hydrate, and rest. The reaction should pass within a few hours. If a severe reaction occurs (swelling, difficulty breathing, confusion, rapid heartbeat), this is a medical emergency — seek help immediately. Induce vomiting only if directed by medical guidance and the ingestion was within 1 hour.

### Step 8: Build Your Knowledge — The Universal Five

Start with five plants found across most of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Master these before expanding your repertoire.

```
The Universal Five (Beginner-Friendly Edible Plants):

1. DANDELION (Taraxacum officinale)
   Habitat: Lawns, fields, disturbed ground (nearly everywhere)
   ID: Basal rosette of toothed leaves; hollow stem; yellow
       composite flower; milky sap (exception to the milky sap rule)
   Edible: Entire plant — leaves (raw/cooked), flowers (raw/fried),
           roots (roasted as coffee substitute)
   Season: Year-round; best in spring before flowering

2. BROADLEAF PLANTAIN (Plantago major)
   Habitat: Lawns, paths, disturbed ground
   ID: Basal rosette of oval leaves with parallel veins;
       tall seed spike; leaves are tough and fibrous
   Edible: Young leaves (raw in salads, older leaves boiled);
           seeds (edible raw or ground)
   Medicinal: Crushed leaves used as poultice for insect bites/stings
   Season: Spring through fall

3. WHITE CLOVER (Trifolium repens)
   Habitat: Lawns, meadows, roadsides
   ID: Three round leaflets (sometimes four); white round flower
       heads; creeping ground cover
   Edible: Flowers (raw or dried for tea); young leaves (raw or
           cooked — cook to improve digestibility)
   Season: Flowers in spring/summer; leaves year-round in mild climates

4. CATTAIL (Typha latifolia / T. angustifolia)
   Habitat: Wetlands, pond edges, ditches, marshes
   ID: Tall (1-3 m); long flat sword-like leaves; distinctive brown
       cigar-shaped seed head
   Edible: Shoot base/heart (raw, spring); pollen (flour substitute,
           summer); rhizome (starchy, peeled and boiled/roasted,
           year-round); young flower spike (boiled, early summer)
   Utility: Fluff = tinder and insulation; leaves = weaving material
   Season: Different parts edible year-round

5. WOOD SORREL (Oxalis spp.)
   Habitat: Forest floor, shaded areas, gardens
   ID: Three heart-shaped leaflets (resembles clover but leaflets are
       notched/heart-shaped); small 5-petaled yellow, white, or pink
       flowers; leaves fold at night
   Edible: Leaves and flowers (raw — pleasant lemony/sour taste)
   Caution: Contains oxalic acid; eat in moderation (not as a staple)
   Season: Spring through fall

Progression:
  Master these 5 → Add 5 regional species → Add 5 more → Build to 20+
  (20 positively known species provides meaningful foraging capability)
```

**Expected:** You can identify all five universal plants on sight using multiple features and know which parts to eat and how to prepare them.

**On failure:** If none of these five are present in your area (e.g., desert, high arctic, tropical), consult region-specific references. These five are specific to temperate zones. In tropical environments, look for coconut palm, banana/plantain, taro (must cook), breadfruit, and moringa. In arid regions, look for prickly pear cactus (Opuntia), mesquite, and agave.

## Validation

- [ ] Deadly plants for the region are known and can be identified on sight
- [ ] Habitat was surveyed and likely edible species were shortlisted
- [ ] Each plant was identified using at least 5 features (multi-feature method)
- [ ] Plant was confirmed as NOT a dangerous look-alike
- [ ] Harvesting was sustainable (no more than 1/3 of any stand)
- [ ] Preparation method was appropriate for the species
- [ ] A small test portion was eaten first with a 1-2 hour monitoring period
- [ ] No adverse reactions occurred before eating a full portion

## Common Pitfalls

- **Single-feature identification**: "It has three leaves like clover" is not enough. Many toxic plants share individual features with edible ones. Always use the full multi-feature checklist
- **Carrot family confusion**: The Apiaceae family (carrot, parsnip, parsley) contains both common foods and the deadliest plants in the Northern Hemisphere. Avoid unless expert-level certain
- **Mushroom foraging in survival situations**: Mushrooms offer little caloric value and include some of the most lethal organisms on earth. The risk-reward ratio is terrible in a survival context
- **Eating too much of a new plant**: Even safe plants can cause digestive upset in quantity, especially if your gut is not accustomed. Start small
- **Ignoring preparation requirements**: Raw fiddleheads, raw elderberries, unleached acorns — some plants that are edible when cooked are mildly toxic raw
- **Foraging near contaminated areas**: Roadsides (lead, exhaust), agricultural margins (pesticides), and industrial zones may have technically edible but contaminated plants

## Related Skills

- `make-fire` — required for cooking foraged plants; many species need boiling or roasting to be safe or palatable
- `purify-water` — clean water is needed for washing foraged plants and for the leaching/boiling preparation methods
