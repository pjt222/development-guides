# Set Up putior CI/CD

Configure GitHub Actions to automatically regenerate workflow diagrams when source code changes, keeping documentation in sync with code.

## When to Use

- Workflow diagrams should always reflect the current state of the code
- The project has CI/CD and wants automated documentation updates
- Multiple contributors may change workflow-affecting code
- Replacing manual diagram regeneration with automated pipeline

## Inputs

- **Required**: GitHub repository with putior annotations in source files
- **Required**: Target file for diagram output (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/workflow.md`)
- **Optional**: putior theme (default: `"github"`)
- **Optional**: Source directories to scan (default: `"./R/"` or `"./src/"`)
- **Optional**: Branch to trigger on (default: `main`)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create the workflow YAML file for automated diagram generation.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/update-workflow-diagram.yml
name: Update Workflow Diagram

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'R/**'
      - 'src/**'
      - 'scripts/**'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  update-diagram:
    if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          use-public-rspm: true

      - name: Install putior
        run: |
          install.packages("putior")
        shell: Rscript {0}

      - name: Generate workflow diagram
        run: |
          Rscript scripts/generate-workflow-diagram.R

      - name: Commit updated diagram
        run: |
          git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add README.md docs/workflow.md  # Adjust to match your target files
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "docs: update workflow diagram [skip ci]"
          git push
```

**Expected**: File created at `.github/workflows/update-workflow-diagram.yml`.

**On failure**: Ensure the `.github/workflows/` directory exists. Adjust the `paths` filter to match where annotated source files live in the repository.

### Step 2: Write Generation Script

Create the R script that generates the diagram and updates target files using sentinel markers.

```r
# scripts/generate-workflow-diagram.R
library(putior)

# Scan source files for annotations
workflow <- put_merge("./R/", merge_strategy = "supplement")

# Generate Mermaid code
mermaid_code <- put_diagram(workflow, output = "raw", theme = "github")

# Read target file (e.g., README.md)
readme <- readLines("README.md")

# Find sentinel markers
start_marker <- "<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-START -->"
end_marker <- "<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-END -->"

start_idx <- which(readme == start_marker)
end_idx <- which(readme == end_marker)

if (length(start_idx) == 1 && length(end_idx) == 1 && end_idx > start_idx) {
  # Replace content between sentinels
  new_content <- c(
    readme[1:start_idx],
    "",
    "```mermaid",
    mermaid_code,
    "```",
    "",
    readme[end_idx:length(readme)]
  )
  writeLines(new_content, "README.md")
  cat("Updated README.md workflow diagram\n")
} else {
  warning("Sentinel markers not found in README.md. Add them manually:\n",
          start_marker, "\n", end_marker)
}

# Also write standalone diagram file
writeLines(
  c("# Workflow Diagram", "",
    "```mermaid", mermaid_code, "```"),
  "docs/workflow.md"
)
cat("Updated docs/workflow.md\n")
```

**Expected**: Script at `scripts/generate-workflow-diagram.R` that reads annotations, generates Mermaid code, and replaces content between sentinel markers.

**On failure**: If `put_merge()` returns empty, check that source paths match the repository layout. Adjust `"./R/"` to the actual source directory.

### Step 3: Configure Auto-Commit

The workflow must avoid infinite loops where an auto-commit re-triggers the same workflow. Pushes made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` typically do not trigger new workflow runs, but the workflow also includes an explicit `if:` guard on the job as a safety net.

Key configuration points:
- `permissions: contents: write` grants push access
- `if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'` skips the job when the push came from the bot itself
- `git diff --staged --quiet || git commit` only commits if there are changes
- `[skip ci]` in the commit message is a convention some CI systems honor (not built into GitHub Actions, but useful as a signal)
- Bot identity used for commits: `github-actions[bot]`

**Expected**: The workflow only commits when diagrams actually change. No empty commits, no infinite loops.

**On failure**: If push fails with permission denied, check repository settings: Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions must be set to "Read and write permissions".

### Step 4: Add Sentinel Markers to README

Insert sentinel markers in the target file where the diagram should appear.

```markdown
## Workflow

<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-START -->
<!-- This section is auto-generated by putior CI. Do not edit manually. -->

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Placeholder — will be replaced on next CI run"]
```

<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-END -->
```

**Expected**: Sentinel markers in README.md (or other target file). The content between them will be replaced on each CI run.

**On failure**: Ensure markers are on their own lines with no leading/trailing whitespace. The script matches exact line content.

### Step 5: Test the Pipeline

Trigger the workflow and verify the diagram updates.

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger the workflow
echo "# test" >> R/some-file.R
git add R/some-file.R
git commit -m "test: trigger workflow diagram update"
git push

# Monitor the GitHub Actions run
gh run watch

# Verify the diagram was updated
git pull
cat README.md | grep -A 5 "PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-START"
```

**Expected**: GitHub Actions run completes successfully. The diagram between sentinel markers in README.md is updated with current workflow data.

**On failure**: Check the Actions log for errors. Common issues:
- `putior` package not available: add to `DESCRIPTION` Suggests or install explicitly in the workflow
- Source path wrong: the R script's `put_merge()` path must be relative to the repo root
- No sentinel markers: the script warns but doesn't crash; add markers to README.md

## Validation

- [ ] `.github/workflows/update-workflow-diagram.yml` exists and is valid YAML
- [ ] `scripts/generate-workflow-diagram.R` runs without errors locally
- [ ] README.md contains `<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-START -->` and `<!-- PUTIOR-WORKFLOW-END -->` sentinels
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push to the correct branch and paths
- [ ] Diagram content between sentinels is updated after a workflow run
- [ ] Job-level `if:` guard prevents infinite commit loops from bot pushes
- [ ] No changes = no commit (idempotent)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Infinite CI loops**: Pushes with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` typically don't trigger new runs, but always add an explicit `if: github.actor != 'github-actions[bot]'` guard on the job. The `[skip ci]` tag in the commit message is a useful convention but is not a built-in GitHub Actions mechanism.
- **Permission denied on push**: GitHub Actions needs write permission. Set `permissions: contents: write` in the workflow file, or configure it in repository settings.
- **Sentinel marker mismatch**: If markers have trailing spaces, leading tabs, or are on the same line as other content, the script won't find them. Keep markers on their own clean lines.
- **Source path mismatch**: The R script runs from the repo root. Paths like `"./R/"` or `"./src/"` must match the actual directory structure.
- **Package installation in CI**: If the project uses renv, the CI workflow needs `renv::restore()` before putior is available. Alternatively, install putior explicitly in the workflow.
- **Large repos slowing CI**: For repos with many source files, limit the `paths` trigger filter to directories that contain PUT annotations, not the entire repo.
