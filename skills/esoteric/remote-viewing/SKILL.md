# Remote View

Conduct a structured remote viewing session using the Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV) protocol to perceive and describe a distant or unseen target through non-local awareness.

## When to Use

- A target has been designated (coordinates, sealed envelope, or blind tasking) and needs perceptual data
- Practicing structured intuitive perception in a controlled, repeatable format
- Developing the non-local awareness skills that complement healing work (see `heal`)
- Training mental discipline and perceptual acuity beyond analytical thinking
- Exploring consciousness research in the tradition of the SRI/Stargate program

## Inputs

- **Required**: Target reference (coordinate pair, alphanumeric code, or sealed envelope — must be blind to the viewer)
- **Required**: Paper and pen (CRV is a pen-on-paper protocol; do not use digital devices during the session)
- **Required**: Quiet, undisturbed space (minimum 30 minutes)
- **Optional**: Monitor/tasker (a person who provides the target and guides the session)
- **Optional**: Meditation warmup completed (see `meditate` — strongly recommended)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Cooldown

Transition from analytical daily-mind into the receptive state required for remote viewing. This step is non-negotiable.

1. Sit comfortably with paper and pen ready
2. Close your eyes and perform 5 minutes of breath-focused meditation (see `meditate`, Steps 2-3)
3. Release all expectations about the target — you know nothing and should want to know nothing yet
4. Let mental chatter slow naturally; do not force silence
5. When you feel a shift from "thinking about" to "being present," you are ready
6. Open your eyes and write the target reference (coordinate or code) at the top of your paper

**Expected:** A calm, open mental state with minimal internal dialogue. The analytical mind is quieted but not asleep. You feel alert and receptive.

**On failure:** If the mind remains busy after 5 minutes, extend the cooldown to 10 minutes. If a specific concern is intrusive, write it on a separate sheet ("parking lot") and set it aside. Do not begin Stage I while mentally agitated — the signal will be drowned in noise.

### Step 2: Ideogram (Stage I)

The ideogram is a spontaneous mark made in response to the target signal. It bypasses the analytical mind.

1. Write the target reference on the paper
2. Touch pen to paper
3. In one quick, spontaneous motion, let the pen make a mark — do not think, plan, or draw deliberately
4. The ideogram is typically a short squiggle, curve, or angular mark (1-3 seconds to produce)
5. Immediately decode the ideogram by probing it:
   - **A** (activity at the site): motion, stillness, energy
   - **B** (feeling/sensation): hard, soft, wet, dry, warm, cold, rough, smooth
6. Write the A and B components next to the ideogram
7. If the ideogram feels incomplete, repeat (produce a second ideogram) — but no more than 3 total

**Expected:** A spontaneous mark on paper that feels "right" — not drawn from imagination but arrived from somewhere else. The A/B decode produces immediate, simple descriptors (not complex imagery).

**On failure:** If the ideogram is clearly a deliberate drawing (you thought about what to draw), set it aside and try again after 30 seconds of breath focus. If you cannot produce a spontaneous mark, the cooldown was insufficient — return to Step 1. The ideogram should take less than 2 seconds; anything longer is analytical.

### Step 3: Sensory Impressions (Stage II)

Systematically collect sensory data about the target without interpretation.

```
Stage II Sensory Channels:
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Channel      │ What to Report                                     │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Visuals      │ Colors, brightness, contrast, patterns (NOT       │
│              │ objects — "blue" not "ocean")                      │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Textures     │ Rough, smooth, grainy, slippery, porous, metallic │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Temperatures │ Hot, cold, warm, cool, ambient, fluctuating       │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Sounds       │ Loud, quiet, rhythmic, sharp, humming, rushing    │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Smells       │ Sharp, sweet, chemical, organic, damp, dry        │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tastes       │ Metallic, salty, sweet, bitter, neutral            │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Dimensionals │ Wide, tall, narrow, enclosed, open, deep, layered │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Energetics   │ Moving, still, vibrating, dense, light, pressured │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. Probe each sensory channel in turn, writing one descriptor per line
2. Write quickly — first impression only, do not deliberate
3. Use single words or short phrases, never sentences
4. If a channel produces nothing, write "nothing" and move on — do not fabricate
5. Circle any descriptor that feels particularly strong or confident
6. This stage typically produces 10-20 data points over 5-10 minutes

**Expected:** A list of raw sensory descriptors that feel "received" rather than "invented." Some will be strong hits, some noise. The data should be low-level (textures, colors, temperatures) not high-level (names, functions, labels).

**On failure:** If every descriptor feels fabricated, you have slipped into imagination. Stop, close your eyes, take 3 breaths, and re-contact the target by touching pen to the ideogram. If one channel dominates (e.g., all visual), deliberately shift to an underused channel. If the data stream dries up completely, move to Stage III.

### Step 4: Dimensional Data (Stage III)

Move from raw sensory data to spatial and structural information about the target.

1. Close your eyes briefly and sense the overall scope of the target — is it large or small, enclosed or open, natural or constructed?
2. Begin a rough sketch of the target's spatial layout (not a picture — a diagram of proportions and relationships)
3. Probe for dimensions: height, width, depth, number of distinct areas
4. Note spatial relationships: "tall structure to the left, open area to the right, something below"
5. Write dimensional descriptors alongside the sketch
6. Note any sense of purpose or function as "AI" (Aesthetic Impact) — how the target makes you feel, not what it is

**Expected:** A rough spatial diagram with dimensional annotations. The target's general scope (indoor/outdoor, natural/constructed, large/small) becomes clearer. Aesthetic impact notes capture the "feeling" of the site.

**On failure:** If the sketch feels like pure imagination, simplify: draw only basic shapes (circles, rectangles, lines) representing spatial relationships. If no dimensional data comes, return to Stage II sensory probing and look for dimensional hints in textures and temperatures (e.g., "enclosed" often correlates with "warm, still, echo").

### Step 5: Sketch the Target

Create a more developed visual representation based on accumulated data.

1. On a fresh sheet, draw what the accumulated data suggests — NOT what you think the target is
2. Use the sensory descriptors to guide the sketch: if "smooth, curved, tall" appeared, draw a smooth curved tall form
3. Label areas of the sketch with the sensory data that generated them
4. Add any new impressions that arise during sketching — the act of drawing often opens new data
5. Do not erase or second-guess; if a new impression contradicts an earlier one, draw both and note the conflict

**Expected:** A sketch that represents the perceptual data collected so far. It may not look like anything recognizable — that is fine. The sketch serves as a spatial summary, not an identification.

**On failure:** If you cannot sketch, use written spatial descriptions instead. "Tall form center, low flat area right, rounded shape upper left." The sketch is a tool for organizing perception, not an art exercise.

### Step 6: Manage Analytical Overlay (AOL)

AOL occurs when the analytical mind attempts to name, label, or identify the target. It is the primary source of error in remote viewing.

```
AOL Types:
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Type             │ Description and Response                        │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AOL (naming)     │ The mind declares "it's a bridge" or "it's a   │
│                  │ mountain." WRITE "AOL: bridge" and move on.     │
│                  │ Do not pursue or suppress it.                   │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AOL Drive        │ The naming becomes insistent and recurring.     │
│                  │ Write "AOL Drive: [label]" and take a 60-second │
│                  │ break with eyes closed before continuing.       │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AOL Signal       │ The AOL may contain a valid signal component.   │
│                  │ After declaring the AOL, extract the sensory    │
│                  │ component: if "bridge," note "spanning, long,   │
│                  │ connecting two areas" as valid data.            │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ AOL Peacocking   │ The mind constructs an elaborate, detailed      │
│                  │ scenario. This is imagination, not signal.      │
│                  │ Write "AOL/P" and return to Stage II basics.    │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The discipline of CRV is not avoiding AOL — it is recognizing and declaring it so it does not contaminate the data. Every viewer experiences AOL. Skilled viewers catch it quickly.

**Expected:** AOL is recognized within seconds of arising, declared on paper, and the session continues without derailment. Sensory-level data is separated from analytical labels.

**On failure:** If AOL takes over the session (you realize you have been constructing a narrative for several minutes), write "AOL Break," close your eyes, take 10 breaths, and restart from Stage II. A session heavily contaminated by AOL should be marked as such in the review and given less evidential weight.

### Step 7: Stage IV and Beyond (Optional)

For experienced viewers, later stages probe deeper into target characteristics.

**Stage IV** (Emotional/Intangible):
1. Probe for emotional tone at the target site
2. Note intangible impressions: purpose, significance, historical context
3. Write these separately and mark them as Stage IV data

**Stage V** (Interrogation):
1. Direct specific questions at the target: "What is the primary function?" "Who is associated with this?"
2. Write the first impression that arises — do not deliberate
3. Mark all Stage V data clearly; it carries higher AOL risk

**Stage VI** (3D Model):
1. Build a clay or detailed sketch model from all accumulated data
2. Use this to test spatial relationships and discover overlooked elements

**Expected:** Deeper, more specific data about the target that goes beyond physical description into function, purpose, and meaning. Stage IV+ data requires strong Stage I-III foundation.

**On failure:** If later stages produce only AOL, return to earlier stages. The CRV protocol is sequential for a reason — each stage builds on the foundation of the previous one. Skipping stages produces unreliable data.

### Step 8: Close and Review

End the session formally and review all data before feedback.

1. Write "Session End" and the current time on your paper
2. Review all pages in order: ideogram, sensory data, dimensional data, sketches, AOL declarations
3. Circle the 5-10 data points you feel most confident about
4. Write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of your overall impression — what the target feels like, not what it is
5. If working with a tasker/monitor: hand over all session papers before receiving feedback
6. After feedback (target reveal): compare your data point by point, noting hits, misses, and AOL contamination
7. File the session for future reference and pattern recognition

**Expected:** A complete session record with clearly separated raw data, AOL declarations, and a summary. Upon feedback, some data points will match the target clearly, some will be misses, and some will be ambiguous.

**On failure:** If the session feels like it produced nothing useful, review anyway — viewers frequently underestimate their accuracy because they are looking for exact identification rather than descriptive matches. A "tall, smooth, cold, outdoor, historical" description that matches a monument is a successful session even if you never named it.

## Validation

- [ ] Cooldown was performed and analytical mind settled before beginning
- [ ] Ideogram was spontaneous (under 2 seconds), not deliberate
- [ ] Stage II data consists of low-level sensory descriptors, not analytical labels
- [ ] All AOL was declared on paper at the moment of recognition
- [ ] Session progressed through stages sequentially (I → II → III → sketch → higher)
- [ ] Target was blind to the viewer throughout the session
- [ ] Session was closed formally with summary before feedback
- [ ] All session papers are preserved for review

## Common Pitfalls

- **Breaking protocol order**: Jumping to "what is it?" before collecting sensory data guarantees AOL contamination. Trust the sequential process
- **Suppressing AOL**: Trying not to think analytical thoughts creates tension and more AOL. Declare it, extract the signal component, and move on
- **Front-loading**: Any information about the target before the session (even "it's a place" vs "it's a person") biases all subsequent data. Strict blindness is essential
- **Confusing imagination with signal**: Imagination feels effortful and constructed; signal feels received and often surprising. If it makes perfect narrative sense, it is probably AOL
- **Insufficient cooldown**: The single most common cause of poor sessions. Five minutes is minimum; ten is better. Meditation practice (see `meditate`) dramatically improves cooldown quality

## Related Skills

- `meditate` — the shamatha concentration developed in meditation is the foundation of the mental stillness required for CRV
- `heal` — energy healing and remote viewing share non-local awareness and practitioner presence; both benefit from the same mental training
- `forage-plants` — detailed sensory observation of plants develops the perceptual acuity used in Stage II
