# Meditate

Conduct a structured meditation session that develops concentration, awareness, and equanimity through progressive techniques.

## When to Use

- Beginning or deepening a personal meditation practice
- Preparing the mind for focused work requiring sustained attention
- Grounding before or after energy healing work (see `heal`)
- Developing the mental stillness required for remote viewing (see `remote-viewing`)
- Managing stress, anxiety, or emotional turbulence
- Integrating experiences from wilderness immersion (see bushcraft skills)

## Inputs

- **Required**: Available time for the session (minimum 10 minutes, recommended 20-45 minutes)
- **Required**: A space where you will not be interrupted
- **Optional**: Meditation technique preference (shamatha, vipassana, mantra; default: shamatha)
- **Optional**: Experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced; default: beginner)
- **Optional**: Timer or bell (phone timer is acceptable; set to a gentle tone)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare the Space

Choose a location that supports stillness and minimal distraction.

1. Select a quiet area — indoors or outdoors, sheltered from wind
2. Temperature should be comfortable (slightly cool is better than warm for alertness)
3. Dim harsh lighting or face away from bright light sources
4. Remove or silence devices (or set a single gentle timer)
5. If outdoors, sit on a stable surface away from insect activity (a raised log, flat rock, or folded cloth)

**Expected:** A quiet, stable environment where you can sit undisturbed for the planned session length.

**On failure:** If no quiet space is available, use earplugs or accept ambient sound as part of the practice. Outdoor sounds (wind, birds, water) can serve as meditation objects. The key requirement is that you will not be physically interrupted.

### Step 2: Establish Posture

Choose a posture that balances alertness with relaxation. The spine should be upright but not rigid.

└────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

Alignment checklist:
1. Hips tilted slightly forward (anterior tilt) to support the spine's natural curve
2. Spine stacked — imagine a string pulling the crown of the head toward the sky
3. Shoulders relaxed and rolled slightly back
4. Chin tucked slightly (back of neck long)
5. Eyes: softly closed or half-open with a downward gaze at 45 degrees
6. Jaw unclenched, tongue resting on the roof of the mouth
7. Hands in a comfortable position — palms down on knees, or cupped in the lap

**Expected:** A stable posture that can be maintained without significant discomfort for the planned session length. Body is alert but not tense.

**On failure:** If pain develops within the first 5 minutes, adjust. Pain is not the practice. Switch to a more supported posture (add cushion height, switch to chair). Numbness in the legs during longer sits is normal and passes — shift only if it becomes a strong distraction.

### Step 3: Anchor on the Breath

The breath is the primary meditation object across all techniques. Establish a clear connection before deepening.

1. Take 3 deep breaths to transition: inhale fully, exhale completely with a sigh
2. Let the breath return to its natural rhythm — do not control it
3. Choose an anchor point: nostrils (feeling of air entering/leaving), chest (rise/fall), or abdomen (expansion/contraction)
4. Place your full attention on the chosen anchor point
5. Notice each breath: the beginning of the inhale, the middle, the end; the pause; the beginning of the exhale, the middle, the end
6. If it helps, silently count breaths: 1 on the inhale, 2 on the exhale, up to 10, then restart

**Expected:** Attention rests on the breath for several consecutive breath cycles. The mind begins to settle. Thoughts still arise but there is awareness of the breath underneath them.

**On failure:** If the mind scatters immediately, shorten the count cycle (count to 5 instead of 10). If counting feels mechanical, drop it and simply note "in" and "out" silently. The breath anchor will strengthen with practice — even 3 consecutive attended breaths is a strong start for beginners.

### Step 4: Work with Distractions

Distraction is not failure — it is the practice. The moment you notice you have wandered IS the moment of mindfulness.

```
Handling Mental Activity:
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Distraction Type   │ Response                                     │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Thought stream     │ Label "thinking" silently and return to      │
│ (planning, memory) │ breath. Do not follow the narrative.         │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Emotion            │ Label the emotion ("anger", "sadness",       │
│ (anger, sadness,   │ "joy"). Notice where it lives in the body.  │
│ excitement)        │ Let it be without suppressing or indulging.  │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Physical sensation │ Note it ("itching", "warmth", "pressure").   │
│ (itch, pain, temp) │ Observe without reacting for 30 seconds.    │
│                    │ Most sensations pass. Adjust only if needed. │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Drowsiness         │ Open eyes wider, straighten spine, take 3    │
│                    │ sharp breaths through the nose. If persistent│
│                    │ switch to standing posture or walking.       │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Restlessness       │ Acknowledge the energy without acting on it. │
│                    │ Feel it as raw sensation in the body. If     │
│                    │ extreme, do 1 minute of deep breathing       │
│                    │ before returning to the anchor.              │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The key skill is a light, non-judgmental return to the breath. Each return strengthens concentration. Self-criticism about wandering IS another thought to label and release.

**Expected:** Over the course of a session, the frequency of wandering decreases and the speed of noticing increases. The gap between wandering and noticing narrows.

**On failure:** If frustration builds from constant wandering, soften the approach. Instead of concentrating hard, try simply "being with" the breath — like sitting by a river, not trying to control the water. If a particular thought or emotion is overwhelming, switch to it as the meditation object temporarily (observe it fully), then return to breath when it passes.

### Step 5: Deepen with Shamatha (Calm Abiding)

Shamatha develops single-pointed concentration. This is the recommended technique for all levels.

1. Continue breath awareness from Step 3
2. Gradually narrow focus: from the general sense of breathing to the precise sensation at the nostrils
3. Notice the subtlest details: temperature of air in vs. out, the tiny pause between breaths, the texture of sensation
4. When concentration stabilizes (fewer than 1-2 wanderings per minute), release the counting and rest in bare awareness of breath
5. If the mind becomes very still, notice that stillness itself — this is the beginning of access concentration
6. Maintain this level for the remainder of the session or transition to vipassana (Step 6)

Session timing by level:
- Beginner: 10-15 minutes at Steps 3-5
- Intermediate: 20-30 minutes, aiming for extended periods of unwavering attention
- Advanced: 30-60 minutes, cultivating jhana (absorption) states

**Expected:** A progressively calmer and more focused mind. Thoughts slow. Awareness of the present moment sharpens. Body feels settled and relaxed.

**On failure:** If concentration does not deepen despite consistent practice, check posture (slumping reduces alertness), check breath (if you are unconsciously controlling it, release control), and check expectation (wanting stillness is itself a distraction). Concentration develops over weeks and months, not within a single session.

### Step 6: Explore Mindfulness with Vipassana (Insight)

Vipassana builds on the concentration developed in shamatha to observe the nature of experience itself. Recommended only after concentration is reasonably stable.

1. From a settled state, widen awareness beyond the breath to include all sensations
2. Observe whatever arises — sound, body sensation, thought, emotion — without preference
3. Notice three characteristics in every experience:
   - **Impermanence** (anicca): every sensation arises and passes away
   - **Unsatisfactoriness** (dukkha): clinging to pleasant or resisting unpleasant creates tension
   - **Non-self** (anatta): sensations arise on their own; there is no controller
4. Practice "noting": silently label each experience as it arises — "hearing", "tingling", "thinking", "pleasant", "unpleasant"
5. Maintain equanimity: equal interest in pleasant and unpleasant experiences
6. If the mind becomes agitated or destabilized, return to shamatha (Step 5) to re-establish calm

**Expected:** Moments of clear seeing where the arising and passing of phenomena is observed directly. A sense of spaciousness. Reduced identification with thought content.

**On failure:** If vipassana feels destabilizing (rapid emotional shifts, anxiety, disorientation), return immediately to shamatha and breath anchoring. Insight practice can temporarily amplify difficult mind states. This is recognized in traditional practice (the "dukkha nanas") and is best navigated with a qualified teacher for advanced stages.

### Step 7: Close the Session

A proper closing integrates the session and transitions back to activity.

1. When the timer signals (or you sense completion), do not stand immediately
2. Take 3 deep, intentional breaths
3. Gradually widen awareness: from the meditation object to the body, to sounds in the room, to the space around you
4. Gently move fingers and toes, rotate the wrists and ankles
5. If eyes were closed, open them slowly with a downward gaze before looking up
6. Sit for 1-2 additional minutes in open awareness — not meditating, not yet active
7. Mentally note: what was the quality of the session? What did you notice? No judgment, just observation
8. Set an intention for carrying mindful awareness into the next activity

**Expected:** A smooth transition from meditative state to activity. Residual calm and clarity persist. No grogginess or disorientation.

**On failure:** If you feel groggy, take 5 sharp breaths and stretch before standing. If the session surfaces unresolved emotion, journal briefly or move into walking meditation before resuming tasks. If the body is stiff, do gentle stretching (2-3 minutes) before moving into activity.

## Validation

- [ ] Space was prepared and interruptions prevented
- [ ] Posture supported both alertness and comfort throughout the session
- [ ] Breath was established as the primary anchor before deepening
- [ ] Distractions were met with labeling and return, not suppression or indulgence
- [ ] Technique matched experience level (shamatha first, vipassana only if stable)
- [ ] Session was closed with a gradual transition, not an abrupt stop
- [ ] Post-session state is calm and alert, not groggy or agitated

## Common Pitfalls

- **Trying too hard**: Concentration is developed by gentle persistence, not forceful effort. Straining creates tension, the opposite of the goal
- **Judging the session**: "Good" and "bad" sessions are both practice. A session full of distraction where you noticed the distraction 50 times IS 50 moments of mindfulness
- **Skipping posture setup**: Poor posture guarantees physical distraction within minutes. Invest time in a stable, aligned seat
- **Jumping to advanced techniques**: Vipassana without shamatha foundation can be destabilizing. Build concentration before insight
- **Inconsistent practice**: One 45-minute session per week is less effective than 10 minutes daily. Regularity matters more than duration
