# Heal

Apply a layered healing approach combining energetic, herbal, physical, and holistic techniques to support recovery, balance, and wellbeing.

## When to Use

- Someone has a physical ailment or injury that needs immediate stabilization and ongoing support
- Energetic imbalance is suspected (persistent fatigue, emotional stagnation, disrupted sleep)
- Herbal remedies are appropriate and plant materials are available (see `forage-plants`)
- A holistic session is requested combining breathwork, visualization, and body scan
- Post-meditation integration reveals areas needing directed healing attention (see `meditate`)

## Inputs

- **Required**: Description of the condition or intention (physical, energetic, emotional, or general wellness)
- **Required**: Available resources (herbs, clean water, first aid supplies, quiet space)
- **Optional**: Recipient's experience level with energy work (default: none assumed)
- **Optional**: Known contraindications (allergies, medications, injuries, pregnancy)
- **Optional**: Time available for the session (default: 30-60 minutes)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Assess Holistically

Before selecting any modality, assess the full picture across physical, energetic, and emotional dimensions.

```
Assessment Triage Matrix:
┌────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ Dimension      │ Observe                  │ Action Priority          │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Physical       │ Visible injury, bleeding,│ HIGH — stabilize first   │
│                │ breathing difficulty,     │ (Step 6)                 │
│                │ pain location/intensity  │                          │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Energetic      │ Temperature variations,  │ MEDIUM — address after   │
│                │ tingling, heaviness,     │ physical stability       │
│                │ numbness in body regions │ (Steps 3-4)              │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Emotional      │ Mood state, anxiety,     │ MEDIUM — weave through   │
│                │ grief, agitation,        │ all steps via presence   │
│                │ withdrawal               │ and breathwork (Step 7)  │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│ Environmental  │ Safety of location,      │ HIGH — secure space      │
│                │ temperature, noise,      │ before beginning any     │
│                │ available materials      │ modality                 │
└────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

Ask the recipient (or assess yourself): Where is the discomfort? When did it start? What makes it better or worse? Any known causes?

**Expected:** A clear picture of the primary complaint, its dimension (physical/energetic/emotional), and a prioritized plan of which steps to emphasize.

**On failure:** If the condition is unclear, begin with the body scan in Step 7 to locate areas of tension, heat, or blocked energy before selecting a modality.

### Step 2: Select Modalities

Based on the assessment, choose one or more modalities appropriate to the situation.

```
Modality Selection Guide:
┌────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│ Modality           │ Best For                 │ Prerequisites        │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│ Energy healing     │ Energetic imbalance,     │ Quiet space, focused │
│ (Reiki/laying on)  │ emotional processing,    │ intention, grounded  │
│                    │ stress, recovery support  │ practitioner state   │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│ Herbal remedies    │ Digestive issues, minor  │ Identified plants,   │
│                    │ wounds, inflammation,     │ clean water, fire    │
│                    │ sleep support, immune     │ (see `make-fire`)    │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│ First aid          │ Bleeding, burns, sprains,│ First aid supplies   │
│                    │ fracture stabilization,   │ or improvised        │
│                    │ shock prevention          │ materials            │
├────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│ Holistic           │ General wellness, anxiety,│ No materials needed  │
│ (breath/visual.)   │ grounding, integration,  │ beyond a quiet space │
│                    │ pain management           │                      │
└────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

Modalities can be combined. A typical session might begin with breathwork to ground, move into energy healing for the primary issue, and close with an herbal tea for integration.

**Expected:** A session plan with 1-3 modalities ordered by priority, estimated time per modality, and materials needed.

**On failure:** If unsure which modality to select, default to the holistic sequence (Step 7) — breathwork and visualization are universally safe and require no materials.

### Step 3: Establish Energetic Connection

Center yourself before directing any energy work. An ungrounded practitioner transfers agitation rather than healing.

1. Sit or stand with feet flat, spine straight
2. Take 5 slow breaths: inhale 4 counts, hold 2, exhale 6 counts
3. Visualize roots extending from your feet into the earth, drawing up stable energy
4. Bring attention to your hands — notice warmth, tingling, or pulsing
5. Set a clear intention: "I intend to support healing for [specific condition]"
6. If working with another person, ask permission before touching or directing energy

**Expected:** Hands feel warm or activated. Mental chatter has quieted. A sense of calm focus is present. Intention is clearly held.

**On failure:** If you cannot settle into a grounded state, spend additional time with the breathwork in Step 7 before returning here. Do not proceed with energy work while distracted or anxious — the session quality depends on practitioner presence.

### Step 4: Apply Energy Healing

Direct healing energy through hands-on or hands-hovering technique over the affected area or energy center.

```

1. Place hands 5-10 cm above the target area (or lightly on it with permission)
2. Hold position for 3-5 minutes per area, breathing steadily
3. Notice sensations: heat, cold, tingling, pulsing, or a "drawing" feeling
4. If energy feels stuck (dense, cold, static), visualize light dissolving the blockage
5. If energy feels depleted (hollow, cool), visualize warm light filling the area
6. Move to related chakras or adjacent areas as intuitively guided
7. Close by sweeping hands from head to feet 5-10 cm from the body, 3 times

**Expected:** Recipient reports warmth, relaxation, tingling, or emotional release. Practitioner's hands may feel temperature changes or pulsing. Session length: 15-30 minutes.

**On failure:** If neither practitioner nor recipient notices any sensation, focus on the heart center (most universally responsive) and extend hold time to 7-10 minutes. If the recipient is uncomfortable, switch to hands-hovering rather than contact. Energy work requires no belief to function but does require practitioner presence — return to Step 3 if focus has drifted.

### Step 5: Prepare Herbal Remedies

When herbal support is appropriate, prepare remedies from available materials.

├───────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Minor wound   │ Yarrow leaf     │ Chew or crush to poultice; apply  │
│               │                 │ directly to clean wound            │
├───────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤

│               │                 │ sting site for 10-15 min          │
├───────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
│ Immune support│ Elderberry,     │ Simmer berries/root 20 min;       │
│               │ echinacea root  │ drink 1 cup 2-3x daily            │
└───────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘

CAUTION: Positive identification is essential before ingesting any plant.
See `forage-plants` for identification protocols.
Use `purify-water` for safe water and `make-fire` for heating.
```

**Expected:** A prepared remedy appropriate to the condition, made from positively identified materials with clean water.

**On failure:** If plant identification is uncertain, do NOT ingest. External poultices carry less risk than ingestion but still require correct plant ID. If no suitable herbs are available, skip this step and rely on other modalities.

### Step 6: First Aid Stabilization

For physical injuries, stabilize before applying any esoteric modalities.

1. **Bleeding**: Apply direct pressure with clean cloth, elevate above heart if possible, maintain pressure 10-15 minutes without checking
2. **Burns**: Cool with clean running water for 10-20 minutes, cover loosely with clean cloth, do not apply ice or butter
3. **Sprains**: Rest, Ice (or cold water), Compression (wrap firmly not tightly), Elevation
4. **Shock signs** (pale, cold, rapid pulse, confusion): Lay flat, elevate legs, keep warm, speak reassuringly
5. **Breathing difficulty**: Sit upright, loosen clothing, coach slow breathing (4-count in, 6-count out)

**Expected:** Bleeding controlled, pain managed, shock prevented, and recipient stabilized enough for transport or continued care.

**On failure:** If bleeding does not stop with direct pressure after 15 minutes, apply pressure to the arterial pressure point upstream of the wound. If shock symptoms worsen, keep the person warm and conscious while seeking emergency help. First aid stabilization takes absolute priority over all other modalities.

### Step 7: Integrate Holistic Techniques

These techniques can stand alone or weave into any other modality.

**Breathwork** (5-10 minutes):
1. Guide slow, rhythmic breathing: 4-count inhale, 2-count hold, 6-count exhale
2. For pain: direct attention to the breath rather than the pain; on each exhale, visualize tension leaving the area
3. For anxiety: extend the exhale (4-in, 7-out) to activate parasympathetic response
4. For energy: use vigorous breath (rapid inhale/exhale through the nose, 30 cycles) then hold — caution: may cause dizziness

**Visualization** (5-10 minutes):
1. Guide the recipient to visualize healing light (any color that feels right) entering through the crown
2. Direct the light to the area of concern
3. Visualize the light dissolving darkness, congestion, or pain
4. Expand the light to fill the entire body
5. Seal the visualization by imagining the body enclosed in protective light

**Body Scan** (10-15 minutes):
1. Start at the crown of the head
2. Move attention slowly downward through each body region
3. At each region, notice: tension, temperature, sensation, emotion
4. Where blockage is found, breathe into that area for 3-5 breaths
5. Continue down to the soles of the feet
6. Note any areas that need further attention in subsequent steps

**Expected:** Recipient reports increased relaxation, reduced pain perception, or emotional release. Body scan identifies specific areas for targeted follow-up.

**On failure:** If the recipient cannot focus on visualization, simplify to breath-only. If body scan triggers emotional distress, slow down and offer the option to skip that body region. The goal is never to force through resistance.

### Step 8: Monitor and Follow Through

1. After the session, allow 5-10 minutes of quiet rest
2. Offer water (see `purify-water` if in wilderness)
3. Ask: "How do you feel compared to when we started?"
4. Note any areas that shifted and any that remain unchanged
5. Recommend: ongoing self-care (continued breathwork, herbal tea, rest)
6. For energy work: advise the recipient to drink extra water and rest for the remainder of the day
7. For herbal remedies: specify dosage and frequency (typically 2-3 times daily for teas)
8. Schedule follow-up if the condition is ongoing

**Expected:** Recipient reports improvement or at least no worsening. A follow-up plan is in place for ongoing conditions.

**On failure:** If the condition worsened, reassess (return to Step 1) and consider whether a different modality is needed. For persistent or serious physical conditions, seek conventional medical attention — these modalities are complementary, not replacements for professional care.

## Validation

- [ ] Holistic assessment was completed before selecting modalities
- [ ] Physical injuries were stabilized before esoteric modalities were applied
- [ ] Practitioner was grounded and centered before beginning energy work
- [ ] Any herbs used were positively identified (see `forage-plants`)
- [ ] Water used for remedies was safe (see `purify-water`)
- [ ] Recipient gave consent before hands-on or energy-directed work
- [ ] Session included a closing integration period and follow-up plan
- [ ] No modality was forced through recipient resistance

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping physical stabilization**: Energy work on a bleeding wound is irresponsible. Always stabilize first, then layer in other modalities
- **Misidentified herbs**: Incorrect plant identification can cause poisoning. When in doubt, do not ingest. External poultice is safer than tea, but still requires correct ID
- **Ungrounded practitioner**: Attempting energy work while anxious or scattered transmits agitation. Spend the time to ground properly in Step 3
- **Overriding recipient autonomy**: Never continue a technique the recipient finds uncomfortable. Healing requires trust and consent
- **Substituting for professional care**: These modalities complement but do not replace emergency medicine, surgery, or pharmaceutical treatment for serious conditions
- **Ignoring emotional release**: Energy work can surface grief, anger, or memories. This is normal. Hold space without trying to fix, interpret, or rush past it
