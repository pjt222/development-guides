# Observe Insect Behavior

Conduct structured insect behavior observations using standardized sampling protocols, ethograms, and quantitative recording methods.

## When to Use

- You are studying insect behavior for ecological or entomological research
- You want to document the behavioral repertoire of a species at a site
- You are observing pollinator activity on flowering plants
- You are documenting predator-prey interactions or parasitoid behavior
- You need behavioral data to support conservation or management decisions
- You are building ethological skills through structured field practice

## Inputs

- **Required**: A focal insect or insect aggregation to observe
- **Required**: A timing device (watch, phone, or stopwatch)
- **Required**: Recording method (notebook, voice recorder, or data entry device)
- **Optional**: Hand lens (10x) for close behavioral observation
- **Optional**: Binoculars for observing insects at distance (e.g., dragonflies on patrol)
- **Optional**: Camera for video documentation of behavioral events
- **Optional**: Thermometer, hygrometer, or weather station for environmental data
- **Optional**: Pre-printed data sheets or ethogram templates

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose a Sampling Protocol

Select the protocol that matches your research question and the behavior of your target insect. Each protocol has specific strengths and biases.

```
Sampling Protocols:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Protocol           | Description and Best Use                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Focal animal       | Follow one individual continuously for   |
| sampling           | a fixed time period. Record all          |
|                    | behaviors as they occur.                 |
|                    | Best for: detailed behavioral sequences, |
|                    | time budgets, individual-level data.     |
|                    | Duration: 5-30 minutes per focal bout.   |
|                    | Bias: loses data when individual moves   |
|                    | out of sight.                            |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Scan sampling      | At fixed intervals (e.g., every 60       |
|                    | seconds), quickly scan all visible       |
|                    | individuals and record what each is      |
|                    | doing at that instant.                   |
|                    | Best for: group-level behavior, activity |
|                    | proportions, social insects.             |
|                    | Bias: misses rare or brief behaviors.    |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| All-occurrences    | Record every instance of a specific      |
| sampling           | behavior (e.g., every flower visit,      |
|                    | every aggressive encounter) within a     |
|                    | defined area and time.                   |
|                    | Best for: rare but conspicuous events,   |
|                    | interaction rates, pollinator visits.    |
|                    | Bias: misses simultaneous events.        |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Instantaneous      | At fixed intervals, record the behavior  |
| (point) sampling   | of one focal individual at that exact    |
|                    | instant. Often combined with focal       |
|                    | animal sampling.                         |
|                    | Best for: time budget calculation with   |
|                    | statistical rigor.                       |
|                    | Bias: misses brief behaviors between     |
|                    | sample points.                           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+

Choosing a Protocol:
- "I want to know everything one individual does" → focal animal
- "I want to know what a group is doing right now" → scan
- "I want to count how often a specific event happens" → all-occurrences
- "I want statistically rigorous time budgets" → instantaneous
```

**Expected:** A sampling protocol selected and justified based on the research question, target taxon, and field conditions. Recording interval or focal bout duration defined before observation begins.

**On failure:** If the target insect is too mobile for focal animal sampling (e.g., a fast-flying dragonfly), switch to all-occurrences sampling focused on specific events (territorial chases, perch returns). If you cannot distinguish individuals for focal sampling, use scan sampling on the group. Adapt the protocol to what is feasible rather than abandoning observation.

### Step 2: Define the Ethogram

An ethogram is the catalog of all behaviors you will record. Define it before observation begins so you are not improvising categories in the field.

```
Standard Insect Ethogram:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Category           | Behavioral States and Events             |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Locomotion         | Walking, running, flying (straight,      |
|                    | hovering, patrolling, pursuit), jumping, |
|                    | crawling, climbing, burrowing, swimming  |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Feeding            | Probing (flower, substrate), chewing     |
|                    | (leaf, prey), sucking (phloem, blood,    |
|                    | nectar), lapping, regurgitating, filter  |
|                    | feeding (aquatic larvae)                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Grooming           | Leg rubbing (cleaning antennae with      |
|                    | front legs), wing cleaning, body         |
|                    | brushing, proboscis extension/retraction |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Reproduction       | Courtship display, copulation attempt,   |
|                    | copulation, mate guarding, oviposition   |
|                    | (egg-laying), nest construction          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Defense            | Fleeing, dropping (thanatosis/death      |
|                    | feigning), startle display (wing flash), |
|                    | stinging, biting, chemical release       |
|                    | (spraying, bleeding), aggregation        |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Communication      | Stridulation (sound production),         |
|                    | pheromone release (wing fanning, gland   |
|                    | exposure), visual signaling (wing        |
|                    | display, bioluminescence), vibrational   |
|                    | signaling (substrate drumming)           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Rest               | Stationary with no visible activity,     |
|                    | basking (thermoregulation in sun),       |
|                    | roosting, sheltering                     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+

Modifiers (append to any category):
- Substrate: on leaf, on flower, on bark, on ground, on water, in flight
- Orientation: upward, downward, horizontal, head-into-wind
- Intensity: low (slow, intermittent), medium, high (rapid, sustained)
```

**Expected:** A complete ethogram defined for the target taxon before observation begins. Categories should be mutually exclusive (any behavior fits in exactly one category) and exhaustive (every observed behavior can be classified).

**On failure:** If an unexpected behavior occurs that does not fit the ethogram, record it verbatim (e.g., "rapid wing vibration while stationary, not matching any defined category") and add a new category in the post-observation ethogram revision. Do not force novel behaviors into ill-fitting categories.

### Step 3: Record Behavioral Events with Timestamps

Begin observation and record each behavioral event or state change with precise timing.

```
Recording Format:

Continuous recording (focal animal):
  Time    | Behavior         | Substrate   | Notes
  --------+------------------+-------------+------------------
  00:00   | Rest             | Leaf (upper)| Dorsal basking
  00:45   | Grooming         | Leaf (upper)| Front legs cleaning antennae
  01:12   | Walking          | Leaf (upper)| Toward leaf edge
  01:30   | Flying           | In flight   | Short flight, 2m
  01:35   | Landing          | Flower head | Tarsi gripping petals
  01:40   | Feeding (nectar) | Flower head | Proboscis extended
  03:15   | Flying           | In flight   | Left observation area
  03:15   | END — focal lost |             | Duration: 3 min 15 sec

Instantaneous recording (at 30-second intervals):
  Time    | Behavior         | Substrate
  --------+------------------+-------------
  00:00   | Rest             | Leaf
  00:30   | Rest             | Leaf
  01:00   | Feeding          | Flower
  01:30   | Feeding          | Flower
  02:00   | Grooming         | Flower
  02:30   | Flying           | In flight

Rules:
- Start the timer before observing; record time to nearest second
  for continuous, to nearest interval for instantaneous
- Record state changes immediately — do not wait for the next interval
  in continuous recording
- If behavior is ambiguous, record what you see, not what you interpret
  (e.g., "rapid wing vibration" not "aggression")
- Note when focal individual is lost and reason (flew away, obscured)
```

**Expected:** A continuous or interval-based record of behavioral events with timestamps, covering the full observation period.

**On failure:** If the focal individual is lost mid-observation, record the time and reason. If it returns, resume recording. If not, the partial record is still valid data — note the actual observation duration. For scan sampling, if some individuals are obscured at the scan moment, record only those visible and note the count of unscored individuals.

### Step 4: Log Interactions

Record all interactions between the focal insect and other organisms. Interactions are behavioral events involving two or more individuals.

```
Interaction Recording Format:
  Time  | Focal behavior  | Partner(s)       | Partner behavior | Outcome
  ------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+----------
  02:10 | Chase (flying)  | Conspecific male  | Fleeing          | Focal won
  04:30 | Feeding (flower)| Honey bee         | Approaching      | Focal left
  06:15 | Death feigning  | Spider (Salticid) | Stalking         | Spider left

Interaction Types:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Type               | Examples                                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Intraspecific      | Territorial defense, courtship, mate     |
| (same species)     | competition, dominance, aggregation,     |
|                    | cooperation (social insects)             |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Predation          | Focal insect capturing prey, or focal    |
|                    | insect being attacked by predator        |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Parasitism         | Parasitoid ovipositing on/in focal; fly  |
|                    | or mite parasitizing focal               |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Mutualism          | Pollination (insect-plant), ant-aphid    |
|                    | tending, mycangial fungi transport       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Competition        | Displacement from food source,           |
| (interspecific)    | interference at nest site                |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+

For each interaction record:
- Who initiated (focal or partner)
- Duration of the interaction
- Outcome (winner/loser, successful/unsuccessful, mutual withdrawal)
- Distance at which interaction began
```

**Expected:** All observed interactions recorded with initiator, partner identity (to lowest taxonomic level possible), behaviors of both parties, and outcome.

**On failure:** If interactions happen too rapidly to record in full (e.g., a swarm of competing males), focus on the focal individual's behavior and note "multiple simultaneous interactions — details approximate." If partner identity is unknown, describe it (e.g., "small black hymenopteran, approximately 8mm").

### Step 5: Record Environmental Context

Environmental conditions strongly influence insect behavior. Record covariates that allow your behavioral data to be interpreted in ecological context.

```
Environmental Context Record:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Variable           | How to Record                            |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Air temperature    | Thermometer reading at insect height,    |
|                    | in shade. Record at start and end of     |
|                    | observation, and hourly for long sessions|
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Relative humidity  | Hygrometer reading. Particularly         |
|                    | important for small insects sensitive    |
|                    | to desiccation                           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Wind speed         | Estimate: calm, light (leaves rustle),   |
|                    | moderate (small branches move), strong   |
|                    | (large branches sway). Anemometer if    |
|                    | available                                |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Cloud cover        | Estimate in oktas (eighths): 0 = clear,  |
|                    | 4 = half-covered, 8 = overcast          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Light intensity    | Full sun, partial shade, full shade, or  |
|                    | lux meter reading if available           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Time of day        | Record start and end times. Note         |
|                    | position relative to sunrise/sunset for  |
|                    | crepuscular species                      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Substrate temp     | Surface temperature where insect is      |
|                    | resting (IR thermometer if available).   |
|                    | Important for basking behavior           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Recent weather     | Rain in past 24 hours, frost, drought    |
|                    | conditions — these affect emergence and  |
|                    | activity levels                          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

**Expected:** Environmental covariates recorded at the start and end of each observation session, with intermediate readings for sessions longer than 1 hour.

**On failure:** If instrumentation is unavailable, estimate temperature ("warm, approximately 25C"), humidity ("dry" or "humid"), and wind from sensory cues. Approximate environmental data is far more useful than no environmental data. At minimum, record time of day, cloud cover, and estimated temperature.

### Step 6: Summarize Observations

Analyze the recorded data to produce a structured summary with time budgets, behavioral frequencies, and observed patterns.

```
Summary Analysis:

1. TIME BUDGET (from focal or instantaneous sampling):
   Calculate the proportion of observation time spent in each
   ethogram category.
   Example:
     Feeding:    45% (13.5 min of 30 min observation)
     Locomotion: 25% (7.5 min)
     Grooming:   12% (3.6 min)
     Rest:       10% (3.0 min)
     Defense:     5% (1.5 min)
     Reproduction:3% (0.9 min)

2. BEHAVIORAL FREQUENCIES (from all-occurrences sampling):
   Count the number of times each event occurred per unit time.
   Example:
     Flower visits: 12 per 30 minutes = 0.4 visits/min
     Territorial chases: 3 per 30 minutes = 0.1 chases/min
     Grooming bouts: 8 per 30 minutes = 0.27 bouts/min

3. INTERACTION SUMMARY:
   Tabulate interactions by type and outcome.
   Example:
     Intraspecific aggressive: 3 (focal won 2, lost 1)
     Interspecific displacement: 2 (focal displaced 1, was displaced 1)
     Predation attempt on focal: 1 (unsuccessful)

4. PATTERNS AND OBSERVATIONS:
   Note any temporal patterns (behavior changes with time of day),
   environmental correlations (activity increases with temperature),
   or unexpected behaviors not previously documented for the species.

5. LIMITATIONS:
   Note observation duration, number of focal bouts, any periods
   when the focal individual was lost, and weather conditions that
   may have affected behavior.
```

**Expected:** A structured summary including time budget or behavioral frequencies (depending on sampling protocol), interaction summary, observed patterns, and explicit acknowledgment of limitations.

**On failure:** If the observation session was too short for meaningful time budgets (less than 10 minutes of continuous data), report raw event counts rather than proportions. Note the short duration as a limitation. Even brief observations contribute to understanding if they are honestly reported — a 5-minute observation documenting a rare behavior (e.g., parasitoid oviposition) can be more valuable than hours of resting behavior.

## Validation

- [ ] A sampling protocol was selected and justified before observation began
- [ ] An ethogram was defined with mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories
- [ ] Behavioral events were recorded with timestamps throughout the observation
- [ ] Interactions were logged with initiator, partner, behaviors, and outcomes
- [ ] Environmental covariates were recorded at the start and end of observation
- [ ] A summary analysis was produced with time budgets or behavioral frequencies
- [ ] Limitations of the observation (duration, lost focal time, weather) were noted

## Common Pitfalls

- **Starting without an ethogram**: Improvising behavioral categories during observation leads to inconsistent recording. Define categories before the first observation, even if you revise them afterward
- **Interpreting instead of describing**: Record "mandibles opening and closing rapidly on leaf margin" not "aggressive feeding." Interpretation comes in the analysis, not the field recording. Anthropomorphic labels ("angry," "happy," "confused") have no place in ethological data
- **Observer fatigue**: Continuous focal animal sampling is cognitively demanding. Limit focal bouts to 15-30 minutes with breaks between. Tired observers miss events and make recording errors
- **Disturbing the subject**: Your presence changes behavior. Maintain distance, minimize movement, avoid casting shadows on the insect, and allow a habituation period (2-5 minutes) before starting formal recording
- **Ignoring "nothing happening"**: Rest and inactivity are valid behavioral states that must be recorded. An insect spending 60% of its time resting is an important ecological finding, not boring data to skip
- **Confusing states and events**: A state has duration (feeding for 3 minutes). An event is instantaneous (a single wing flash). Record states with start and end times; record events with a single timestamp. Mixing them produces incoherent time budgets
