# Glyph Enhance

Improve an existing pictogram glyph in the `viz/` visualization layer — audit its current rendering, diagnose visual issues, apply targeted modifications, re-render, and compare before/after.

## When to Use

- A glyph renders poorly at small sizes (details lost, shapes merge)
- A glyph's visual metaphor is unclear or doesn't match the skill it represents
- A glyph has proportion issues (too large, too small, off-center)
- The neon glow effect overpowers or underwhelms the glyph
- A glyph looks good in one palette but poor in others
- Batch improvement after adding new palettes or changing the rendering pipeline

## Inputs

- **Required**: Skill ID of the glyph to enhance (e.g., `commit-changes`)
- **Required**: Specific issue to address (readability, proportions, glow, palette compat)
- **Optional**: Reference glyph that demonstrates the desired quality level
- **Optional**: Target palette(s) to optimize for (default: all palettes)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Audit — Assess Current State

Examine the current glyph and identify specific issues.

1. Locate the glyph function:
   - Skill glyphs: `viz/R/primitives*.R` and mapped in `viz/R/glyphs.R`
   - Agent glyphs: `viz/R/agent_primitives.R` and mapped in `viz/R/agent_glyphs.R`
2. Read the glyph function to understand its structure:
   - How many layers does it use?
   - What primitives does it call (from `primitives.R`, `primitives_2.R`, etc.)?
   - What are the scale factors and positioning?
3. View the rendered output:
   - Check `viz/icons/cyberpunk/<domain>/<skillId>.webp` as the reference palette
   - If available, check 2-3 other palettes for cross-palette rendering
   - View at both icon size (~48px in the graph) and panel size (~160px in the detail panel)
4. Score the glyph on the **quality dimensions**:

```
Glyph Quality Dimensions:
+----------------+------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Dimension      | 1-5  | Assessment Criteria                           |
+----------------+------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Readability    |      | Recognizable at 48px? Clear at 160px?         |
| Proportions    |      | Well-centered? Good use of the 100x100 canvas?|
| Metaphor       |      | Does the shape clearly represent the skill?    |
| Glow balance   |      | Glow enhances without overwhelming?            |
| Palette compat |      | Looks good across cyberpunk + viridis palettes?|
| Complexity     |      | Appropriate layer count (not too busy/sparse)? |
+----------------+------+-----------------------------------------------+
```

5. Identify the 1-2 dimensions with the lowest scores — these are the enhancement targets

**Expected:** A clear diagnosis of what's wrong with the glyph and which dimensions to improve. The audit should be specific: "proportions: glyph uses only 40% of canvas" not "looks bad."

**On failure:** If the glyph function is missing or the skill isn't in `glyphs.R`, the glyph may not have been created yet — use `create-skill-glyph` instead.

### Step 2: Diagnose — Root Cause Analysis

Determine why the identified issues exist.

1. For **readability** issues:
   - Too many fine details that merge at small sizes?
   - Insufficient contrast between glyph elements?
   - Lines too thin (< 1.5 `size` at s=1.0)?
   - Elements too close together?
2. For **proportion** issues:
   - Scale factor `s` too small or too large?
   - Center offset from (50, 50)?
   - Elements extending beyond the safe area (10-90 range)?
3. For **glow** issues:
   - Glyph stroke width interacts with `ggfx::with_outer_glow()`:
     - Thin lines: glow makes them fuzzy
     - Thick fills: glow adds excessive bloom
   - Multiple overlapping elements: compound glow creates hot spots
4. For **palette compatibility** issues:
   - Glyph uses hardcoded colors instead of `col`/`bright` parameters?
   - Low-contrast palettes (cividis, mako) make the glyph invisible?
   - The glyph relies on color variation that some palettes don't provide?
5. Document the specific root cause for each issue

**Expected:** Root causes that directly point to code changes. "The glyph is too small" → "scale factor is 0.6 but should be 0.8." "Glow overwhelms" → "three overlapping filled polygons each generate glow."

**On failure:** If the root cause isn't obvious from code inspection, render the glyph in isolation with different parameters to isolate the issue. Use `render_glyph()` with a single glyph to test.

### Step 3: Modify — Apply Targeted Fixes

Edit the glyph function to address the diagnosed issues.

1. Open the file containing the glyph function
2. Apply modifications specific to the diagnosis:
   - **Scale/proportion**: Adjust `s` multiplier or element offsets
   - **Readability**: Simplify complex elements, increase stroke width, add spacing
   - **Glow balance**: Reduce overlapping filled areas, use outlines where fills create bloom
   - **Palette compat**: Ensure all colors derive from `col`/`bright` parameters, add alpha for depth
3. Follow the **glyph function contract**:
   ```r
   glyph_name <- function(cx, cy, s, col, bright) {
     # cx, cy = center (50, 50)
     # s = scale (1.0 = ~70% of canvas)
     # col = domain color, bright = brightened variant
     # Returns: list() of ggplot2 layers
   }
   ```
4. Preserve the function signature — do not change parameters
5. Keep modifications minimal: fix the diagnosed issues, don't redesign the entire glyph

**Expected:** A modified glyph function that addresses the specific issues identified in Steps 1-2. Changes are targeted and minimal — enhance, don't redesign.

**On failure:** If the modifications make other dimensions worse (e.g., fixing proportions breaks readability), revert and try a different approach. If the glyph needs a complete redesign, use `create-skill-glyph` instead.

### Step 4: Re-render — Generate Updated Icons

Render the modified glyph and verify the fix.

1. Re-render the specific glyph using the build pipeline:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/d/dev/p/development-guides/viz
   Rscript build-icons.R --skills <skill-id> --palette all
   ```
   For agent glyphs:
   ```bash
   Rscript build-agent-icons.R --agents <agent-id> --palette all
   ```
2. Verify the output files exist:
   - `viz/icons/<palette>/<domain>/<skillId>.webp` for each palette
3. Check file sizes — icons should be 2-15 KB (WebP):
   - Under 2 KB: glyph may be too simple or rendering failed
   - Over 15 KB: glyph may be too complex (too many layers)

**Expected:** Fresh icon files generated for all palettes. File sizes are in the expected range.

**On failure:** If `build-icons.R` errors, check the R console output for the specific error. Common causes: missing closing parenthesis in the glyph function, referencing undefined primitives, or returning non-list from the function. If rendering succeeds but output is blank, the glyph layers may be outside the canvas bounds.

### Step 5: Compare — Before/After Verification

Verify the enhancement improved the target dimensions.

1. Compare old and new renderings:
   - View the cyberpunk palette version at both icon (48px) and panel (160px) sizes
   - View at least 2 other palettes (one light like turbo, one dark like mako)
2. Re-score the quality dimensions from Step 1:
   - Target dimensions should improve by at least 1 point
   - Non-target dimensions should not decrease
3. If the glyph is used in the force-graph, test it there:
   - Start the HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8080` from `viz/`
   - Load the graph and find the skill node
   - Verify the icon renders correctly at default zoom and when zoomed in
4. Document the changes made and the improvement achieved

**Expected:** Measurable improvement on the target dimensions with no regression on others. The glyph looks better at both sizes and across palettes.

**On failure:** If improvement is marginal or regression occurs, revert the changes and reconsider the diagnosis. Sometimes the original glyph's limitations are inherent to the metaphor, not the implementation — in that case, the metaphor itself may need to change (escalate to `create-skill-glyph`).

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Current glyph audited with specific issue diagnosis
- [ ] Root cause identified for each issue
- [ ] Modifications targeted to diagnosed issues (not over-edited)
- [ ] Glyph function contract preserved (signature unchanged)
- [ ] Icons re-rendered for all palettes
- [ ] Before/after comparison shows improvement on target dimensions
- [ ] No regression on non-target dimensions
- [ ] File sizes in expected range (2-15 KB WebP)
- [ ] Glyph renders correctly in force-graph context (if applicable)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-enhancement**: Fixing one issue and then tweaking everything else. Stick to the diagnosed issues
- **Breaking the contract**: Changing the function signature breaks the rendering pipeline. The 5-parameter contract is immutable
- **Palette-specific optimization**: Making the glyph perfect for cyberpunk but poor for viridis. Always check 3+ palettes
- **Ignoring small-size rendering**: A beautiful 160px icon that becomes a blob at 48px is a failed enhancement
- **Forgetting to re-render**: Editing the function without running `build-icons.R` means the changes aren't visible
