# Basic Obedience

Teach foundation commands (sit, stay, come, heel, down) using positive reinforcement and marker training.

## When to Use

- A new puppy (8+ weeks) is ready for foundation training
- An adult dog lacks reliable basic commands
- A rescue or rehomed dog needs to learn the household's command vocabulary
- Before advancing to more complex behaviors or off-leash work
- When existing commands have degraded and need re-establishing

## Inputs

- **Required**: A dog (any breed, any age 8+ weeks)
- **Required**: High-value treats (small, soft, quickly consumed)
- **Optional**: Clicker or verbal marker word (e.g., "yes")
- **Optional**: 6-foot leash and flat collar or harness
- **Optional**: Quiet training space with minimal distractions (initially)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish the Marker

The marker bridges the gap between the desired behavior and the reward.

```
Marker Training Protocol:
1. Choose your marker: clicker (precise) or verbal "yes" (always available)
2. Charge the marker (10-15 reps):
   - Mark (click or "yes") then immediately deliver a treat
   - No behavior required — just marker → treat, marker → treat
   - Dog should begin orienting toward you at the sound of the marker
3. Test: mark when the dog is looking away. Does the dog turn toward
   you expecting a treat? If yes, the marker is charged.

Timing Rule:
The marker must occur WITHIN 1 second of the desired behavior.
Late marking teaches the wrong behavior.
Mark → then reach for the treat (not the reverse).
```

**Expected:** The dog reliably orients toward the handler upon hearing the marker, expecting a reward.

**On failure:** If the dog does not respond to the marker after 20 reps, the treat value is too low. Switch to higher-value rewards (cheese, chicken, liver). If the dog is too distracted to eat, the environment is too stimulating — move to a quieter space.

### Step 2: Teach the Five Foundation Commands

Work on one command per session until reliable, then begin mixing.

```
Command Protocols:

SIT:
1. Hold treat above dog's nose, slowly arc backward over the head
2. As the dog's head follows up, the rear naturally lowers
3. The instant the rear touches the ground → mark and treat
4. Add the verbal cue "sit" AFTER the dog is offering the behavior reliably
   (cue comes before behavior only once the dog understands the behavior)

DOWN:
1. From a sit, hold treat at the dog's nose then lower slowly to the ground
2. Draw the treat slightly forward along the ground
3. As elbows touch the ground → mark and treat
4. If the dog stands instead, reset and try with less forward movement

STAY:
1. Ask for a sit or down
2. Open palm toward the dog, say "stay"
3. Wait 1 second → mark and treat while the dog is still in position
4. Gradually increase duration: 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 1 min
5. Add distance: one step back, then two, then five
6. Add distraction: only after duration and distance are solid
   (the "three Ds": Duration, Distance, Distraction — increase one at a time)

COME (recall):
1. Start on a long line (15-30 ft) in a low-distraction environment
2. Let the dog wander, then call name + "come" in an upbeat tone
3. If the dog turns toward you → mark → reward generously when the dog arrives
4. NEVER call "come" for something unpleasant (bath, crate, leaving the park)
5. Recall is the most important safety command — make it the most rewarding

HEEL:
1. Dog on your left side, treat in left hand at your hip
2. Take one step, if the dog moves with you → mark and treat
3. Gradually increase to two steps, five steps, ten steps
4. Mark and treat for maintaining position (head roughly at your knee)
5. If the dog pulls ahead, stop walking. Resume when the leash is loose.
```

**Expected:** Each command is performed reliably in a low-distraction environment with treats as motivation.

**On failure:** If a command is not progressing after 3 sessions, break it into smaller steps. The dog may need an intermediate behavior (e.g., for "down," reward the head-lowering motion before requiring full elbows-on-ground).

### Step 3: Structure Training Sessions

```
Session Guidelines:
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Parameter          | Guideline                                |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Duration           | 5-10 minutes (puppies: 3-5 minutes)      |
| Frequency          | 2-3 sessions per day                     |
| End on success     | Always end after a successful rep, not   |
|                    | after a failure                          |
| Reward rate        | Initially: every correct rep             |
|                    | Later: intermittent (variable schedule)  |
| Energy management  | High-energy dog? Exercise BEFORE training|
|                    | Low-energy dog? Train when most alert    |
| Session structure  | Warm-up (easy known command) → new       |
|                    | material → cool-down (easy command)      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------+

The 80/20 Rule:
- 80% of reps should succeed (dog is getting it right)
- If success rate drops below 80%, the criteria is too high — go easier
- 20% challenge keeps the dog engaged without frustrating
```

**Expected:** Short, successful sessions that leave the dog wanting more.

**On failure:** If the dog disengages (sniffing, looking away, lying down), the session is too long, too hard, or the rewards are insufficiently motivating. End the session and reassess.

### Step 4: Distraction-Proof the Commands

Once reliable in a quiet environment, systematically add distractions.

```
Distraction Ladder (work through sequentially):
1. Quiet room, no distractions (starting point)
2. Room with a family member present
3. Backyard or garden
4. Front yard with street noise
5. Quiet park or trail
6. Busy park with other dogs at a distance
7. Busy park with other dogs nearby
8. Novel environments (pet store, cafe patio)

At each new level:
- Expect performance to decrease — this is normal
- Increase reward rate back to every correct rep
- Do not add more distraction until the current level is reliable
- If the dog fails 3 reps in a row, you moved up too fast — go back one level
```

**Expected:** Commands work reliably in progressively more distracting environments.

**On failure:** If a specific distraction (other dogs, squirrels) consistently breaks training, that distraction needs separate counter-conditioning work (see `behavioral-modification`).

## Validation

- [ ] Marker is charged and the dog responds reliably
- [ ] All five commands are performed in a low-distraction environment
- [ ] Training sessions are 5-10 minutes, ending on success
- [ ] Success rate is at or above 80% for each command
- [ ] Commands are being generalized through the distraction ladder
- [ ] The handler's timing (marker within 1 second) is consistent

## Common Pitfalls

- **Repeating the cue**: Saying "sit, sit, SIT" teaches the dog that the first "sit" is optional. Say it once and wait
- **Treating too late**: The treat should follow the marker within 2-3 seconds. Late treating breaks the association
- **Luring forever**: The hand motion with the treat (lure) should be faded within 10-20 reps. Otherwise the dog only responds when food is visible
- **Punishing failed recalls**: Calling "come" and then scolding the dog (for being slow, for having something in its mouth) poisons the recall cue permanently
- **Training too long**: A fatigued dog learns nothing. Quit while ahead
- **Inconsistent cues**: All household members must use the same words and gestures for each command
