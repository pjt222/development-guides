# Behavioral Modification

Address unwanted dog behaviors through desensitization, counter-conditioning, and environmental management.

## When to Use

- A dog shows reactivity (lunging, barking, growling) toward other dogs, people, or stimuli
- Separation anxiety manifests as destructive behavior, vocalization, or house soiling when left alone
- Resource guarding: the dog stiffens, growls, or snaps when approached while eating or holding an object
- Excessive barking, jumping, pulling on leash, or other behaviors that interfere with daily life
- After basic obedience is established — behavioral modification builds on foundation commands

## Inputs

- **Required**: A specific unwanted behavior to address (not "the dog is bad" but "the dog lunges at other dogs on leash")
- **Required**: The dog's threshold distance or trigger level (how close/intense before the behavior starts)
- **Optional**: History of the behavior (when it started, what triggers it, what makes it worse)
- **Optional**: High-value treats that the dog will eat even when mildly stressed
- **Optional**: Veterinary clearance (rule out pain or medical causes for behavior changes)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify and Define the Behavior

Precision matters — vague descriptions lead to vague interventions.

```
Behavior Analysis (ABC Model):
+-------------+------------------------------------------+
| Component   | Define Specifically                      |
+-------------+------------------------------------------+
| Antecedent  | What happens BEFORE the behavior?        |
| (Trigger)   | e.g., "sees another dog within 30 feet"  |
+-------------+------------------------------------------+
| Behavior    | What EXACTLY does the dog do?             |
|             | e.g., "stiffens, stares, then lunges and |
|             | barks"                                   |
+-------------+------------------------------------------+
| Consequence | What happens AFTER the behavior?          |
|             | e.g., "owner pulls the dog away; the     |
|             | other dog leaves" (behavior is reinforced |
|             | because the trigger goes away)           |
+-------------+------------------------------------------+

Threshold Mapping:
- At what distance/intensity does the dog first notice the trigger? (alert)
- At what distance/intensity does the dog become unable to take treats? (over threshold)
- The working zone is BELOW threshold — where the dog notices but can still think
```

**Expected:** A precise behavior definition with identified trigger, threshold distance, and current consequence pattern.

**On failure:** If the behavior seems to have no consistent trigger, keep a log for one week: date, time, context, behavior, consequence. Patterns often emerge that are not obvious in the moment.

### Step 2: Choose the Intervention Strategy

```
Strategy Selection:
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Behavior                   | Primary Strategy                  | Timeline        |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Reactivity (dogs/people)   | Desensitization + counter-        | 4-12 weeks      |
|                            | conditioning (DS/CC)              |                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Separation anxiety         | Graduated absence protocol +      | 6-16 weeks      |
|                            | management                        |                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Resource guarding          | Trade-up protocol +               | 4-8 weeks       |
|                            | approach desensitization          |                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Excessive barking          | Identify function → teach         | 2-6 weeks       |
|                            | alternative behavior              |                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Leash pulling              | Penalty yards (stop when          | 2-4 weeks       |
|                            | pulling) + reward position        |                 |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
```

**Expected:** A specific strategy selected for the identified behavior.

**On failure:** If the behavior is severe (biting with contact, extreme panic, self-harm), refer to a certified applied animal behaviorist (CAAB) or veterinary behaviorist (DACVB). This skill covers moderate behavioral issues, not clinical cases.

### Step 3: Execute Desensitization and Counter-Conditioning

The core protocol for reactivity and fear-based behaviors.

```
DS/CC Protocol:
1. FIND the threshold: position the dog where the trigger is visible
   but the dog is still calm enough to eat treats

2. MARK and TREAT: trigger appears → mark → treat → treat → treat
   (classical conditioning: trigger predicts good things)

3. CRITERIA: the dog should be:
   - Able to eat treats
   - Ears relaxed or neutral (not pinned forward)
   - Loose body posture
   - Able to look at the trigger and then look back at the handler

4. DECREASE DISTANCE gradually:
   Session 1: 50 feet from trigger
   Session 3: 45 feet
   Session 5: 40 feet
   (Only decrease when the dog is consistently relaxed at current distance)

5. SESSION STRUCTURE:
   - 5-15 minutes maximum
   - 3-5 trigger exposures per session
   - End BEFORE the dog goes over threshold
   - If the dog goes over threshold, increase distance immediately
     and end on a calmer note

6. PROGRESS INDICATORS:
   - Dog looks at trigger, then immediately looks at handler ("check-in")
   - Dog's threshold distance decreases over sessions
   - Recovery time after exposure shortens
   - Dog's body language at threshold becomes more relaxed
```

**Expected:** Over weeks, the dog's threshold distance decreases and emotional response to the trigger shifts from fear/aggression to neutral or positive.

**On failure:** If no progress after 3-4 weeks of consistent sessions, reassess: (1) are you working below threshold? (2) are the treats high-value enough? (3) is the trigger exposure too frequent outside of training (flooding undoes DS/CC)? (4) consider consulting a professional.

### Step 4: Manage the Environment

Training changes behavior over time. Management prevents rehearsal now.

```
Management Strategies:
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Behavior                   | Management During Training Period        |
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Dog reactivity             | Walk at off-peak hours; cross the street |
|                            | when another dog approaches; use visual  |
|                            | barriers (parked cars, bushes)           |
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Separation anxiety         | Do not leave the dog alone beyond their  |
|                            | current tolerance; use daycare, pet      |
|                            | sitter, or take the dog with you         |
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Resource guarding          | Do not approach while eating; trade up   |
|                            | from a distance; manage access to        |
|                            | high-value items                         |
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Excessive barking          | Block visual triggers (frosted window    |
|                            | film); provide enrichment; address       |
|                            | underlying cause (boredom, anxiety)      |
+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Every rehearsal of the unwanted behavior strengthens it.
Management prevents rehearsal while training builds the new response.
```

**Expected:** The unwanted behavior is not being practiced outside of controlled training sessions.

**On failure:** If management is impossible (e.g., cannot avoid all dog encounters), reduce training criteria to match reality. Some environmental exposure is unavoidable; ensure training sessions provide a strong enough counter-experience.

## Validation

- [ ] The behavior was defined precisely using the ABC model
- [ ] Threshold distance was identified before starting DS/CC
- [ ] Training was conducted consistently below threshold
- [ ] Treats were high-value enough for the dog to eat in the presence of the trigger
- [ ] Sessions were 5-15 minutes, ending before the dog went over threshold
- [ ] Environmental management prevented behavior rehearsal outside training
- [ ] Progress indicators (check-ins, reduced threshold distance) are being tracked

## Common Pitfalls

- **Working over threshold**: The single most common error. If the dog cannot eat treats, you are too close. Move back
- **Inconsistency**: DS/CC requires regular sessions (3-5 per week minimum). Sporadic training produces sporadic results
- **Flooding**: Forcing the dog to endure the trigger at close range does not "get them used to it" — it traumatizes and worsens the behavior
- **Punishment**: Correcting a reactive dog (leash pop, yelling "no") suppresses the warning signals but increases the underlying emotion. The dog learns to bite without warning
- **Expecting linear progress**: Behavioral modification has plateaus and regressions. A bad session does not erase prior progress. Zoom out and look at the trend over weeks
- **Ignoring medical causes**: Pain, thyroid disorders, and neurological issues can all present as behavioral problems. Veterinary clearance is not optional for sudden-onset behavior changes
