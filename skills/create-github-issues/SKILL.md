# Create GitHub Issues

Structured GitHub issue creation from review findings or task breakdowns. Converts a list of findings (from `review-codebase`, `security-audit-codebase`, or manual analysis) into well-formed GitHub issues with labels, acceptance criteria, and cross-references.

## When to Use

- After a codebase review produces a findings table that needs tracking
- After a planning session identifies work items that should become issues
- When converting a TODO list or backlog into trackable GitHub issues
- When batch-creating related issues that need consistent formatting and labeling

## Inputs

- **Required**: `findings` — a list of items, each with at minimum a title and description. Ideally also includes: severity, affected files, and suggested labels
- **Optional**:
  - `group_by` — how to batch findings into issues: `severity`, `file`, `theme` (default: `theme`)
  - `label_prefix` — prefix for auto-created labels (default: none)
  - `create_labels` — whether to create missing labels (default: `true`)
  - `dry_run` — preview issues without creating them (default: `false`)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare Labels

Ensure all needed labels exist in the repository.

1. List existing labels: `gh label list --limit 100`
2. Identify labels needed by the findings (from severity, phase, or explicit label fields)
3. Map severities to labels if not already mapped: `critical`, `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`
4. Map phases/themes to labels: `security`, `architecture`, `code-quality`, `accessibility`, `testing`, `performance`
5. If `create_labels` is true, create missing labels: `gh label create "name" --color "hex" --description "desc"`
6. Use consistent colors: red for critical/security, orange for high, yellow for medium, blue for architecture, green for testing

**Expected:** All labels referenced by findings exist in the repository. No duplicate labels created.

**On failure:** If `gh` CLI is not authenticated, instruct the user to run `gh auth login`. If label creation is denied (insufficient permissions), proceed without creating labels and note which labels are missing.

### Step 2: Group Findings

Batch related findings into logical issues to avoid issue sprawl.

1. If `group_by` is `theme`: group findings by their phase or category (all security findings → 1-2 issues, all a11y → 1 issue)
2. If `group_by` is `severity`: group findings by severity level (all CRITICAL → 1 issue, all HIGH → 1 issue)
3. If `group_by` is `file`: group findings by primary affected file
4. Within each group, order findings by severity (CRITICAL first)
5. If a group has more than 8 findings, split into sub-groups by sub-theme
6. Each group becomes one GitHub issue

**Expected:** A set of issue groups, each containing 1-8 related findings. The total number of issues should be manageable (typically 5-15 for a full codebase review).

**On failure:** If findings have no grouping metadata, fall back to one issue per finding. This is acceptable for small finding sets (< 10) but produces too many issues for larger sets.

### Step 3: Compose Issues

Build each issue using a standard template.

1. **Title**: `[Severity] Theme: Brief description` — e.g., `[HIGH] Security: Eliminate innerHTML injection in panel.js`
2. **Body** structure:
   ```
   ## Summary
   One-paragraph overview of what this issue addresses and why it matters.

   ## Findings
   1. **[SEVERITY]** Finding description (`file.js:line`) — brief explanation
   2. **[SEVERITY]** Finding description (`file.js:line`) — brief explanation

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Criterion derived from finding 1
   - [ ] Criterion derived from finding 2
   - [ ] All changes pass existing tests

   ## Context
   Generated from codebase review on YYYY-MM-DD.
   Related: #issue_numbers (if applicable)
   ```
3. Apply labels: severity label + theme label + any custom labels
4. If findings reference specific files, mention them in the body (not as assignees)

**Expected:** Each issue has a clear title, numbered findings with severity badges, checkbox acceptance criteria, and appropriate labels.

**On failure:** If the body exceeds GitHub's issue size limit (65536 chars), split the issue into parts and cross-reference them.

### Step 4: Create Issues

Create the issues using `gh` CLI and report results.

1. If `dry_run` is true, print each issue title and body without creating, then stop
2. For each composed issue, create it:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   body content
   EOF
   )" --label "label1,label2"
   ```
3. Record the URL of each created issue
4. After all issues are created, print a summary table: `#number | Title | Labels | Findings count`
5. If issues should be sequenced, add cross-references: edit the first issue to mention "Blocked by #X" or "See also #Y"

**Expected:** All issues created successfully. A summary table with issue numbers and URLs is printed.

**On failure:** If an individual issue fails to create, log the error and continue with remaining issues. Report failures at the end. Common failures: authentication expired, label not found (if `create_labels` was false), network timeout.

## Validation

- [ ] All findings are represented in at least one issue
- [ ] Each issue has at least one label
- [ ] Each issue has checkbox acceptance criteria
- [ ] No duplicate issues were created (check titles against existing open issues)
- [ ] Issue count is reasonable for the finding count (not 1:1 for large sets)
- [ ] Summary table was printed with all issue URLs

## Common Pitfalls

- **Issue sprawl**: Creating one issue per finding produces 20+ issues that are hard to manage. Group aggressively — 5-10 issues from a full review is ideal
- **Missing acceptance criteria**: Issues without checkboxes cannot be verified as complete. Every finding should map to at least one checkbox
- **Label chaos**: Creating too many labels makes filtering useless. Stick to severity + theme, not per-finding labels
- **Stale references**: If creating issues from an old review, verify findings still apply before creating issues. Code may have changed
- **Forgetting dry run**: For large finding sets, always preview with `dry_run: true` first. It is much easier to edit a plan than to close 15 incorrect issues

## Related Skills

- `review-codebase` — produces the findings table this skill consumes
- `review-pull-request` — produces PR-scoped findings that can also be converted to issues
- `manage-backlog` — organizes issues into sprints and priorities after creation
- `create-pull-request` — creates PRs that reference and close the issues
- `commit-changes` — commits the fixes that resolve the issues
