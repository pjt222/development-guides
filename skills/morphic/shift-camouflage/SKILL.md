# Shift Camouflage

Implement adaptive surface transformation — polymorphic interfaces, context-aware behavior, and dynamic presentation — inspired by cuttlefish chromatophores. The system's surface adapts to its environment while its core remains stable, reducing attack surface and optimizing interaction with diverse observers.

## When to Use

- A system must present different interfaces to different consumers (API versioning, multi-tenant, role-based)
- Reducing attack surface by exposing only what each observer needs to see
- Implementing feature flags, progressive rollouts, or A/B testing at the interface level
- A system needs to adapt its behavior to environmental context without core changes
- Protecting internal architecture from external coupling (observers couple to the surface, not the structure)
- Complementing `adapt-architecture` when surface change is sufficient and deep transformation is unnecessary

## Inputs

- **Required**: The system whose surface needs adaptation
- **Required**: The observers/consumers and their different interface needs
- **Optional**: Current interface design and its limitations
- **Optional**: Threat model (what should be hidden from which observers?)
- **Optional**: Feature flag system or progressive rollout infrastructure
- **Optional**: Performance constraints (dynamic surface generation has overhead)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Map the Observer Landscape

Identify who interacts with the system and what each observer needs to see.

1. Catalog all observers:
   - External users (end users, API consumers, partners)
   - Internal services (microservices, background jobs, admin tools)
   - Adversaries (attackers, scrapers, competitors)
   - Regulators (auditors, compliance checks)
2. For each observer, define:
   - What they need to see (required interface surface)
   - What they should not see (hidden surface)
   - What they expect to see (compatibility surface — may differ from what they need)
   - How they interact (protocol, frequency, sensitivity)
3. Create the observer-surface matrix:

```
Observer-Surface Matrix:
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Observer     │ Required Surface       │ Hidden Surface  │ Threat Level │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ End users    │ Public API v2, UI      │ Internal APIs,  │ Low          │
│              │                        │ admin endpoints │              │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Partner API  │ Partner API, webhooks  │ Internal logic, │ Medium       │
│              │                        │ user data       │              │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Admin tools  │ Full API, debug        │ Raw data store  │ Low          │
│              │ endpoints              │ access          │              │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Adversaries  │ Nothing (minimal)      │ Everything      │ High         │
│              │                        │ possible        │              │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Expected:** A complete observer landscape with surface requirements per observer. This drives all subsequent camouflage design.

**On failure:** If observer identification is incomplete, start with the two extremes: the most privileged observer (admin) and the most restricted (adversary). Design surfaces for these two, then interpolate for observers between them.

### Step 2: Design Chromatophore Mapping

Create the mapping between observer context and surface presentation — the "chromatophore" layer.

1. Define context signals:
   - Authentication identity → determines privilege level
   - Request origin → geographic, network, or application context
   - Feature flags → enables/disables specific surface elements
   - Time/phase → deployment stage, business hours, maintenance windows
   - Load/health → degraded mode may present reduced surface
2. Design the surface generation rules:
   - For each combination of context signals, define which surface elements are:
     - **Visible**: included in the response/interface
     - **Hidden**: excluded entirely (not even error messages reveal their existence)
     - **Transformed**: present but modified for this observer (different schema, simplified data)
     - **Decoy**: deliberately misleading surface elements for adversarial contexts
3. Implement the chromatophore layer:
   - A thin middleware/proxy that sits between the core system and observers
   - Evaluates context signals on each request
   - Applies the appropriate surface configuration
   - Never modifies core behavior — only filters and transforms the surface

```

```

**Expected:** A chromatophore mapping that translates observer context into surface configuration. The mapping is explicit, auditable, and separate from core logic.

**On failure:** If the mapping becomes too complex (too many context combinations), simplify to role-based surfaces: define 3-5 surface profiles (public, partner, admin, internal, minimal) and map every observer to one profile.

### Step 3: Implement Behavioral Polymorphism

Make the system's behavior adapt to context, not just its surface appearance.

1. Identify context-dependent behaviors:
   - Response detail level (verbose for admin, minimal for public)
   - Rate limiting (generous for partners, strict for unknown callers)
   - Error messages (detailed for internal, generic for external)
   - Data freshness (real-time for premium, cached for standard)
   - Feature availability (full for beta testers, stable-only for general)
2. Implement behavioral variants:
   - Each variant is a complete, tested behavior path
   - Context determines which variant executes
   - Variants share core logic but differ in presentation and policy
3. Feature flag integration:
   - Feature flags control which behavioral variants are active
   - Progressive rollout: expose new behavior to a percentage of observers, increasing over time
   - Circuit breakers: automatically revert to safe behavior if the new variant causes errors

**Expected:** The system's behavior adapts to observer context — the same core logic produces appropriate responses for different audiences. Feature flags enable progressive rollout of new behaviors.

**On failure:** If behavioral polymorphism creates too many code paths, consolidate to a pipeline model: core logic → policy layer → presentation layer. Polymorphism lives in the policy and presentation layers only, keeping core logic singular.

### Step 4: Reduce Attack Surface

Minimize what adversaries can observe and interact with.

1. Apply the principle of least surface:
   - Each observer sees only what they need — nothing more
   - Unauthenticated observers see the minimum possible surface
   - Error messages never leak internal structure (no stack traces, no internal paths, no version numbers)
2. Implement active surface reduction:
   - Remove default pages, headers, and endpoints that reveal technology stack
   - Randomize non-essential response characteristics (timing jitter, header order)
   - Disable unused API endpoints entirely (not just hidden — actually off)
3. Deploy pattern disruption:
   - Vary response characteristics to defeat fingerprinting
   - Introduce controlled unpredictability in non-functional aspects
   - Ensure that functional behavior remains deterministic while surface characteristics vary
4. Monitor for reconnaissance:
   - Detect patterns of requests that probe for hidden surface (enumeration attacks)
   - Alert on repeated access to non-existent endpoints (path fuzzing)
   - Track and correlate reconnaissance patterns across sessions (see `defend-colony`)

**Expected:** A minimal attack surface where adversaries cannot easily determine the system's technology stack, internal structure, or hidden capabilities. Reconnaissance attempts are detected and tracked.

**On failure:** If surface reduction breaks legitimate consumers, the observer-surface matrix is incomplete — legitimate needs are being hidden. Review Step 1 and update the matrix. If randomization causes issues, reduce randomization to non-functional aspects only (timing, headers) and keep functional responses deterministic.

### Step 5: Maintain Surface Coherence

Ensure that the dynamic surface remains consistent, debuggable, and maintainable.

1. Surface testing:
   - Test each observer profile explicitly (does admin see admin surface? does public see public surface?)
   - Test surface transitions (what happens when an observer's context changes mid-session?)
   - Test surface failure modes (what surface appears if the chromatophore layer fails?)
2. Surface documentation:
   - Document each observer profile and its surface configuration
   - Document the context signals and their effects on surface selection
   - Keep documentation in sync with actual behavior (test documentation against reality)
3. Debugging support:
   - Admin/debug mode reveals which surface profile is active and why
   - Logging captures which surface configuration was applied to each request
   - Ability to replay a request through a specific surface profile for debugging
4. Surface evolution:
   - Adding new surface elements: add to the appropriate profiles, test, deploy
   - Removing surface elements: deprecation warning period, then removal
   - Changing surface behavior: feature flag controlled, progressive rollout

**Expected:** A maintainable, testable, well-documented surface adaptation system. The dynamic nature doesn't compromise the ability to debug, document, or evolve the interfaces.

**On failure:** If the chromatophore layer becomes a debugging nightmare, add transparency: every response includes a trace header (visible only to admin/debug profile) indicating which surface profile was applied and which context signals determined it.

## Validation

- [ ] Observer landscape is mapped with surface requirements per observer
- [ ] Chromatophore mapping translates context to surface configuration
- [ ] Behavioral polymorphism adapts responses to observer context
- [ ] Attack surface is minimized for adversarial observers
- [ ] Each observer profile is explicitly tested
- [ ] Surface failure mode presents a safe default (minimal surface)
- [ ] Debug/admin mode can inspect active surface configuration
- [ ] Surface documentation matches actual behavior

## Common Pitfalls

- **Surface complexity explosion**: Too many observer profiles with too many variations. Consolidate to 3-5 profiles maximum. Most observers fit into broad categories
- **Core contamination**: Letting surface adaptation logic leak into core business logic. The chromatophore layer must be separate — if you're adding if-statements about observer type in core code, the architecture is wrong
- **Security through obscurity alone**: Surface reduction is a defense-in-depth layer, not a replacement for proper security controls. A hidden endpoint still needs authentication and authorization
- **Inconsistent surfaces**: Observer A sees version 1 of a response and observer B sees version 2 — but they're supposed to see the same thing. Test surfaces explicitly and keep the observer-surface matrix authoritative
- **Forgetting the failure surface**: When the chromatophore layer itself fails, what surface does the observer see? The default must be safe (minimal surface) not open (full surface)
