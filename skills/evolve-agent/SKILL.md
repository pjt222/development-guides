# Evolve an Existing Agent

Improve, extend, or create an advanced variant of an agent that was originally authored with `create-agent`. This procedure covers the maintenance side of the agent lifecycle: assessing gaps against best practices, applying targeted improvements to the persona definition, bumping versions, and keeping the registry and cross-references in sync.

## When to Use

- An agent's skills list is outdated after new skills were added to the library
- User feedback reveals missing capabilities, unclear purpose, or weak examples
- Tool requirements have changed (new MCP server, tool removed, privilege reduction needed)
- An agent's scope needs sharpening — it overlaps with another agent or is too broad
- An advanced variant is needed alongside the original (e.g., `r-developer` and `r-developer-advanced`)
- Related agents or teams were added and cross-references in See Also are stale

## Inputs

- **Required**: Path to the existing agent file to evolve (e.g., `agents/r-developer.md`)
- **Required**: Evolution trigger (feedback, new skills, tool change, scope overlap, team integration, discovered limitations)
- **Optional**: Target version bump magnitude (patch, minor, major)
- **Optional**: Whether to create an advanced variant instead of refining in-place (default: refine in-place)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Assess the Current Agent

Read the existing agent file and evaluate each section against the quality checklist from `guides/agent-best-practices.md`:

| Section | What to Check | Common Issues |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Frontmatter | All required fields present (`name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `version`, `author`) | Missing `tags`, stale `version`, wrong `priority` |
| Purpose | Specific problem statement, not generic "helps with X" | Vague or overlapping with another agent |
| Capabilities | Concrete, verifiable capabilities with bold lead-ins | Generic ("handles development"), no grouping |
| Available Skills | Matches frontmatter `skills` list, all IDs exist in registry | Stale IDs, missing new skills, lists default skills unnecessarily |
| Usage Scenarios | 2-3 realistic scenarios with invocation patterns | Placeholder text, unrealistic examples |
| Examples | Shows user request and agent behavior | Missing or trivial examples |
| Limitations | 3-5 honest constraints | Too few, too vague, or missing entirely |
| See Also | Valid cross-references to agents, guides, teams | Stale links to renamed or removed files |

```bash
# Read the agent file
cat agents/<agent-name>.md

# Check frontmatter parses
head -20 agents/<agent-name>.md

# Verify skills in frontmatter exist in registry
grep "skills:" -A 20 agents/<agent-name>.md

# Check if agent is referenced by any team
grep -r "<agent-name>" teams/*.md
```

**Expected:** A list of specific gaps, weaknesses, or improvement opportunities organized by section.

**On failure:** If the agent file does not exist or has no frontmatter, this skill does not apply — use `create-agent` instead to author it from scratch.

### Step 2: Gather Evolution Requirements

Identify and categorize what triggered the evolution:

| Trigger | Example | Typical Scope |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| User feedback | "Agent missed XSS in review" | Add skill or capability |
| New skills available | Library gained `analyze-api-security` | Update skills list |
| Tool change | New MCP server available | Add to tools/mcp_servers |
| Scope overlap | Two agents both claim "code review" | Sharpen purpose and limitations |
| Team integration | Agent added to a new team | Update See Also, verify capabilities |
| Model upgrade | Task requires deeper reasoning | Change model field |
| Privilege reduction | Agent has Bash but only reads files | Remove unnecessary tools |

Document the specific changes needed before editing. List each change with its target section:

```
- Frontmatter: add `new-skill-id` to skills list
- Capabilities: add "API Security Analysis" capability
- Available Skills: add `new-skill-id` with description
- Limitations: remove outdated limitation about missing skill
- See Also: add link to new team that includes this agent
```

**Expected:** A concrete list of changes, each mapped to a specific section of the agent file.

**On failure:** If the changes are unclear, consult the user for clarification before proceeding. Vague evolution goals produce vague improvements.

### Step 3: Choose Evolution Scope

Use this decision matrix to determine whether to refine in-place or create a variant:

| Criteria | Refinement (in-place) | Advanced Variant (new agent) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Agent ID | Unchanged | New ID: `<agent>-advanced` or `<agent>-<specialty>` |
| File path | Same `.md` file | New file in `agents/` |
| Version bump | Patch or minor | Starts at 1.0.0 |
| Model | May change | Often higher (e.g., sonnet → opus) |
| Registry | Update existing entry | New entry added |
| Original agent | Modified directly | Left intact, gains See Also cross-reference |

**Refinement**: Choose when updating skills, fixing documentation, sharpening scope, or adjusting tools. The agent keeps its identity.

**Variant**: Choose when the evolved version would serve a substantially different audience, require a different model, or add capabilities that would make the original too broad. The original stays as-is for simpler use cases.

**Expected:** A clear decision — refinement or variant — with rationale.

**On failure:** If unsure, default to refinement. You can always extract a variant later; it is harder to merge one back.

### Step 4: Apply Changes to the Agent File

#### For Refinements

Edit the existing agent file directly:

- **Frontmatter**: Update `skills`, `tools`, `tags`, `model`, `priority`, `mcp_servers` as needed
- **Purpose/Capabilities**: Revise to reflect new scope or added functionality
- **Available Skills**: Add new skills with descriptions, remove deprecated ones
- **Usage Scenarios**: Add or revise scenarios to demonstrate new capabilities
- **Limitations**: Remove constraints that no longer apply, add new honest ones
- **See Also**: Update cross-references to reflect current agent/team/guide landscape

Follow these editing rules:
- Preserve all existing sections — add content, do not remove sections
- Keep the Available Skills section in sync with the frontmatter `skills` list
- Do not add default skills (`meditate`, `heal`) to frontmatter unless they are core to the agent's methodology
- Verify each skill ID exists: `grep "id: skill-name" skills/_registry.yml`

#### For Variants

```bash
# Copy the original as a starting point
cp agents/<agent-name>.md agents/<agent-name>-advanced.md

# Edit the variant:
# - Change `name` to `<agent-name>-advanced`
# - Update `description` to reflect the advanced scope
# - Raise `model` if needed (e.g., sonnet → opus)
# - Reset `version` to "1.0.0"
# - Expand skills, capabilities, and examples for the advanced use case
# - Reference the original in See Also as a simpler alternative
```

**Expected:** The agent file (refined or new variant) passes the assessment checklist from Step 1.

**On failure:** If an edit breaks the document structure, use `git diff` to review changes and revert partial edits with `git checkout -- <file>`.

### Step 5: Update Version and Metadata

Bump the `version` field in frontmatter following semantic versioning:

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Typo fix, wording clarification | Patch: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 | Fixed unclear limitation |
| New skills added, capability expanded | Minor: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 | Added 3 new skills from library |
| Restructured purpose, changed model | Major: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 | Narrowed scope, upgraded to opus |

Also update:
- `updated` date to the current date
- `tags` if the agent's domain coverage changed
- `description` if the purpose is materially different
- `priority` if the agent's importance relative to others changed

**Expected:** Frontmatter `version` and `updated` reflect the magnitude and date of changes. New variants start at `"1.0.0"`.

**On failure:** If you forget to bump the version, the next evolution will have no way to distinguish the current state from the previous one. Always bump before committing.

### Step 6: Update Registry and Cross-References

#### For Refinements

Update the existing entry in `agents/_registry.yml` to match the revised frontmatter:

```bash
# Find the agent's registry entry
grep -A 10 "id: <agent-name>" agents/_registry.yml
```

Update `description`, `tags`, `tools`, and `skills` fields to match the agent file. No count change is needed.

Update cross-references in other files if the agent's capabilities or name changed:

```bash
# Check if any team references this agent
grep -r "<agent-name>" teams/*.md

# Check if any guide references this agent
grep -r "<agent-name>" guides/*.md
```

#### For Variants

Add the new agent to `agents/_registry.yml` in alphabetical position:

```yaml
  - id: <agent-name>-advanced
    path: agents/<agent-name>-advanced.md
    description: One-line description of the advanced variant
    tags: [domain, specialty, advanced]
    priority: normal
    tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob]
    skills:
      - skill-id-one
      - skill-id-two
```

Then:
1. Increment `total_agents` at the top of the registry
2. Add See Also cross-reference in the original agent pointing to the variant
3. Add See Also cross-reference in the variant pointing to the original
4. The `.claude/agents/` symlink to `agents/` means the variant is automatically discoverable

**Expected:** Registry entry matches the agent file frontmatter. For variants, `total_agents` equals the actual number of agent entries.

**On failure:** Count entries with `grep -c "^  - id:" agents/_registry.yml` and verify it matches `total_agents`.

### Step 7: Validate the Evolved Agent

Run the full validation checklist:

- [ ] Agent file exists at the expected path
- [ ] YAML frontmatter parses without errors
- [ ] `version` was bumped (refinement) or set to "1.0.0" (variant)
- [ ] `updated` date reflects today
- [ ] All required sections present: Purpose, Capabilities, Available Skills, Usage Scenarios, Examples, Limitations, See Also
- [ ] Skills in frontmatter match the Available Skills section
- [ ] All skill IDs exist in `skills/_registry.yml`
- [ ] Default skills (`meditate`, `heal`) are not listed unless core to methodology
- [ ] Tools list follows least-privilege principle
- [ ] Registry entry exists and matches frontmatter
- [ ] For variants: `total_agents` count matches actual count on disk
- [ ] Cross-references are bidirectional (original ↔ variant)
- [ ] `git diff` shows no accidental deletions from the original content

```bash
# Verify frontmatter
head -20 agents/<agent-name>.md

# Check skills exist
for skill in skill-a skill-b; do
  grep "id: $skill" skills/_registry.yml
done

# Count agents on disk vs registry
ls agents/*.md | grep -v template | wc -l
grep total_agents agents/_registry.yml

# Review all changes
git diff
```

**Expected:** All checklist items pass. The evolved agent is ready to commit.

**On failure:** Address each failing item individually. The most common post-evolution issues are stale skill IDs in the Available Skills section and a forgotten `updated` date.

## Validation

- [ ] Agent file exists and has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `version` field reflects the changes made
- [ ] `updated` date is current
- [ ] All sections present and internally consistent
- [ ] Frontmatter `skills` array matches the Available Skills section
- [ ] All skill IDs exist in `skills/_registry.yml`
- [ ] Default skills not listed unnecessarily
- [ ] Registry entry matches the agent file
- [ ] For variants: new entry in `agents/_registry.yml` with correct path
- [ ] For variants: `total_agents` count updated
- [ ] Cross-references are valid (no broken links in See Also)
- [ ] `git diff` confirms no accidental content removal

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to bump version**: Without version bumps, there is no way to track what changed or when. Always update `version` and `updated` in frontmatter before committing.
- **Skills list drift**: The frontmatter `skills` array and the `## Available Skills` section must stay in sync. Updating one without the other creates confusion for both humans and tooling.
- **Listing default skills unnecessarily**: Adding `meditate` or `heal` to the frontmatter when they are already inherited from the registry. Only list them if they are core to the agent's methodology (e.g., `mystic`, `alchemist`).
- **Tool over-provisioning during evolution**: Adding `Bash` or `WebFetch` during an evolution "just in case." Every tool addition should be justified by a specific new capability.
- **Stale See Also after variant creation**: When creating a variant, both the original and the variant need to reference each other. One-directional references leave the graph incomplete.
- **Registry entry not updated**: After changing an agent's skills, tools, or description, the `agents/_registry.yml` entry must be updated to match. Stale registry entries cause discovery and tooling failures.
