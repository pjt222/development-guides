# Solve Electromagnetic Induction

Analyze electromagnetic induction phenomena by identifying the source of changing magnetic flux, computing the flux through the relevant surface, applying Faraday's law to obtain the induced EMF, determining the induced current direction via Lenz's law, and solving the resulting circuit equations including RL transients and energy stored in the magnetic field.

## When to Use

- Computing the induced EMF in a loop or coil due to a time-varying magnetic field
- Analyzing motional EMF from a conductor moving through a static B-field
- Determining the direction of induced current using Lenz's law
- Calculating mutual inductance between coupled coils or self-inductance of a single coil
- Solving RL circuit transients (energizing, de-energizing, switching between states)
- Computing energy stored in a magnetic field or in an inductor

## Inputs

- **Required**: Source of changing flux (time-varying B-field, moving conductor, or changing loop area)
- **Required**: Geometry of the circuit or loop through which flux is computed
- **Required**: Relevant physical parameters (B-field magnitude, velocity, resistance, inductance, or geometry for inductance calculation)
- **Optional**: Circuit elements connected to the induction loop (resistors, additional inductors, sources)
- **Optional**: Initial conditions for transient analysis (initial current, initial stored energy)
- **Optional**: Time interval of interest for transient solutions

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Source of Changing Flux

Classify the physical mechanism that produces a time-varying magnetic flux:

1. **Changing B-field**: The magnetic field itself varies in time (e.g., AC electromagnet, approaching magnet, current ramp in a nearby coil). The loop is stationary.
2. **Changing area**: The loop area changes (e.g., expanding or contracting loop, rotating coil in a static field). The B-field may be static.
3. **Moving conductor (motional EMF)**: A straight conductor moves through a static B-field. The flux change arises from the conductor sweeping out area.
4. **Combined**: Both the field and geometry change simultaneously (e.g., a coil rotating in a time-varying field). Separate the contributions for clarity.

For each mechanism, identify the relevant surface S bounded by the circuit loop C:

## Flux Change Classification
- **Mechanism**: [changing B / changing area / motional / combined]
- **Surface S**: [description of the surface bounded by the loop]
- **Time dependence**: [which quantities vary: B(t), A(t), v(t), theta(t)]
- **Relevant parameters**: [B magnitude, loop dimensions, velocity, angular frequency]
```

**Expected:** A clear identification of why the flux changes, what surface to integrate over, and which physical quantities carry the time dependence.

**On failure:** If the source of changing flux is ambiguous (e.g., a deforming loop in a non-uniform field), decompose the problem into a sum of contributions: one from the field change at fixed geometry, and one from the geometry change in the instantaneous field. This decomposition is always valid.

### Step 2: Calculate Magnetic Flux Through the Relevant Surface

Compute the magnetic flux Phi_B = integral of B . dA over the surface S:

1. **Uniform field, flat loop**: Phi_B = B * A * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between B and the area normal vector n_hat. This is the most common textbook case.

2. **Non-uniform field**: Parameterize the surface S and evaluate the integral:
   - Choose coordinates aligned with the surface (e.g., polar for a circular loop)
   - Express B(r) at each point on the surface
   - Compute the dot product B . dA = B . n_hat dA
   - Integrate over the surface

3. **Coupled coils (mutual inductance)**: For coil 2 linked to coil 1:
   - Compute B_1 (field from coil 1) at the location of coil 2
   - Integrate B_1 over the area of each turn of coil 2
   - Multiply by N_2 (number of turns in coil 2) for total flux linkage: Lambda_21 = N_2 * Phi_21
   - Mutual inductance: M = Lambda_21 / I_1

4. **Self-inductance**: For a single coil carrying current I:
   - Compute B inside the coil from the coil's own current
   - Integrate B over one turn's cross-section and multiply by N
   - Self-inductance: L = N * Phi / I = Lambda / I
   - Known results: solenoid L = mu_0 * n^2 * A * l; toroid L = mu_0 * N^2 * A / (2 pi R)

5. **Time dependence**: Express Phi_B(t) explicitly by substituting the time-varying quantities identified in Step 1.

## Flux Calculation
- **Flux expression**: Phi_B(t) = [formula]
- **Evaluation**: [analytic / numeric]
- **Flux linkage** (if multi-turn): Lambda = N * Phi_B = [formula]
- **Inductance** (if applicable): L = [value with units] or M = [value with units]
```

**Expected:** An explicit expression for Phi_B(t) with correct units (Weber = T . m^2) and, if applicable, inductance values with units of Henry.

**On failure:** If the flux integral cannot be evaluated analytically (e.g., non-uniform field over a non-trivial surface), use numerical quadrature. For mutual inductance of complex geometries, consider the Neumann formula: M = (mu_0 / 4 pi) * double_contour_integral of (dl_1 . dl_2) / |r_1 - r_2|.

### Step 3: Apply Faraday's Law for Induced EMF

Compute the induced EMF from the time derivative of the flux:

1. **Faraday's law**: EMF = -d(Lambda)/dt = -N * d(Phi_B)/dt. The negative sign encodes Lenz's law (opposition to the change).

2. **Differentiation**: Take the total time derivative of Phi_B(t):
   - If B = B(t) and A, theta are constant: EMF = -N * A * cos(theta) * dB/dt
   - If theta = omega * t (rotating coil in static B): EMF = N * B * A * omega * sin(omega * t)
   - If the area changes (e.g., sliding rail): EMF = -B * l * v (motional EMF, where l is the rail length and v the velocity)
   - For the general case: use the Leibniz integral rule to differentiate under the integral sign

3. **Motional EMF (alternative derivation)**: For a conductor of length l moving with velocity v in field B:
   - The Lorentz force on charges in the conductor: F = q(v x B)
   - EMF = integral of (v x B) . dl along the conductor
   - This is equivalent to Faraday's law but can be more intuitive for moving conductors

4. **Sign and magnitude check**: The magnitude of EMF should be physically reasonable. For typical laboratory setups: mV to V range. For power generation: V to kV range.

```markdown
## Induced EMF
- **EMF expression**: EMF(t) = [formula]
- **Peak EMF** (if AC): EMF_0 = [value with units]
- **RMS EMF** (if AC): EMF_rms = EMF_0 / sqrt(2) = [value]
- **Derivation method**: [Faraday's law / motional EMF / Leibniz rule]
```

**Expected:** An explicit expression for EMF(t) with correct units (Volts) and physically reasonable magnitude.

**On failure:** If the EMF has wrong units, trace back to the flux calculation -- a missing factor of area or an inconsistent unit system (e.g., mixing CGS and SI) is the most likely cause. If the EMF sign seems wrong, re-examine the surface normal orientation relative to the circuit loop direction (right-hand rule).

### Step 4: Determine Current Direction via Lenz's Law

Establish the direction of the induced current and its physical consequences:

1. **Lenz's law statement**: The induced current flows in the direction that opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. This is a consequence of energy conservation.

2. **Application procedure**:
   - Determine whether the flux through the loop is increasing or decreasing
   - If flux is increasing: induced current creates a B-field that opposes the increase (opposing the external field direction through the loop)
   - If flux is decreasing: induced current creates a B-field that supports the decreasing flux (same direction as the external field through the loop)
   - Use the right-hand rule to convert the required B-field direction into a current direction

3. **Force consequences**: The induced current in the presence of the external B-field experiences a force:
   - Eddy current braking: the force opposes the relative motion (always decelerating)
   - Magnetic levitation: the repulsive force supports weight when the geometry is appropriate
   - These forces are a direct manifestation of Lenz's law at the mechanical level

4. **Qualitative verification**: The induced effects should always resist the change. A falling magnet through a conducting tube falls slower than in free fall. A generator requires mechanical work input to produce electrical energy.

```markdown
## Current Direction
- **Flux change**: [increasing / decreasing]
- **Induced B direction**: [opposing increase / supporting decrease]
- **Current direction**: [CW / CCW as viewed from specified direction]
- **Mechanical consequence**: [braking force / levitation / energy transfer]
```

**Expected:** A clearly stated current direction that is consistent with Lenz's law, with the physical consequence (force, braking, energy transfer) identified.

**On failure:** If the current direction seems to amplify the flux change rather than oppose it, the surface normal orientation or the right-hand rule application is reversed. Re-examine the loop orientation convention. A current that reinforces the flux change would violate energy conservation.

### Step 5: Solve Resulting Circuit Equation

Formulate and solve the circuit equation including the inductance:

1. **RL circuit formation**: When the induced EMF drives current through a circuit with resistance R and inductance L, Kirchhoff's voltage law gives:
   - Energizing (switch closes onto DC source V_0): V_0 = L dI/dt + R I
   - De-energizing (source removed, loop closed): 0 = L dI/dt + R I
   - General (time-varying EMF): EMF(t) = L dI/dt + R I

2. **Solution of the first-order ODE**:
   - Energizing: I(t) = (V_0 / R) * [1 - exp(-t / tau)], where tau = L / R is the time constant
   - De-energizing: I(t) = I_0 * exp(-t / tau)
   - AC drive EMF = EMF_0 sin(omega t): solve using phasor methods or particular + homogeneous solution
   - Transient duration: current reaches ~63% of final value after 1 tau, ~95% after 3 tau, ~99.3% after 5 tau

3. **Energy analysis**:
   - Energy stored in the inductor: U_L = (1/2) L I^2
   - Energy stored in the magnetic field per unit volume: u_B = B^2 / (2 mu_0) in vacuum, or u_B = (1/2) B . H in magnetic materials
   - Power dissipated in resistance: P_R = I^2 R
   - Energy conservation: rate of energy input = rate of energy storage + rate of dissipation

4. **Mutual inductance coupling**: For two coupled coils with mutual inductance M:
   - V_1 = L_1 dI_1/dt + M dI_2/dt + R_1 I_1
   - V_2 = M dI_1/dt + L_2 dI_2/dt + R_2 I_2
   - Coupling coefficient: k = M / sqrt(L_1 L_2), where 0 <= k <= 1
   - Solve the coupled ODEs simultaneously (matrix exponential or Laplace transform)

5. **Steady-state and transient separation**: For AC-driven circuits, decompose the solution into a transient (decaying exponential) and steady-state (sinusoidal at the drive frequency). Report impedance Z_L = j omega L and phase angle.

```markdown
## Circuit Solution
- **Circuit type**: [RL energizing / de-energizing / AC driven / coupled coils]
- **Time constant**: tau = L/R = [value with units]
- **Current solution**: I(t) = [expression]
- **Energy stored**: U_L = [value at specified time]
- **Energy dissipated**: [total or rate]
- **Steady-state impedance** (if AC): Z_L = [value]
```

**Expected:** A complete time-domain solution for the current with correct exponential time constants, energy balance verified, and physically reasonable magnitudes.

**On failure:** If the current grows without bound, a sign error in the ODE setup is likely (the inductance term should oppose changes in current). If the time constant is unreasonably large or small, double-check the inductance calculation from Step 2 and the resistance value. Time constants for typical laboratory RL circuits range from microseconds to seconds.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Wrong sign in Faraday's law**: The EMF is EMF = -d(Lambda)/dt, not +d(Lambda)/dt. The negative sign is essential -- it encodes Lenz's law and energy conservation. Omitting it produces a current that amplifies the flux change, violating thermodynamics.
- **Confusing flux and flux linkage**: For a single-turn loop, Phi_B and Lambda are the same. For an N-turn coil, Lambda = N * Phi_B. Inductance is defined as L = Lambda / I, not L = Phi_B / I. Missing the factor of N produces inductance values that are N times too small.
- **Surface normal inconsistency**: The surface normal n_hat must be related to the loop circulation direction by the right-hand rule. Choosing them independently leads to sign errors in both the flux and the EMF.
- **Ignoring back-EMF in RL circuits**: When current changes in an inductor, the inductor generates a back-EMF that opposes the change. Omitting this term from Kirchhoff's voltage law makes the circuit equation algebraic instead of differential, missing the transient entirely.
- **Assuming instantaneous current change**: Current through an ideal inductor cannot change instantaneously (it would require infinite voltage). Initial conditions for RL transients must satisfy continuity of inductor current across switching events.
- **Neglecting eddy currents in bulk conductors**: Faraday's law applies to any closed path in a conductor, not just discrete wire loops. Time-varying fields in bulk conductors induce distributed eddy currents that produce heating (loss) and opposing fields (shielding). These are critical in transformer cores and must be minimized with lamination.
