# Catalog Collection

Catalog and classify library or archival materials using standard classification systems and descriptive cataloging practices.

## When to Use

- You are organizing a personal, institutional, or community library from scratch
- You need to assign call numbers and subject headings to new acquisitions
- You want to create consistent catalog records for findability
- You are reclassifying a collection that has outgrown its original system
- You need to establish authority control for authors, series, or subjects

## Inputs

- **Required**: Materials to catalog (books, serials, media, archival items)
- **Required**: Chosen classification system (Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress)
- **Optional**: Existing catalog or inventory to integrate with
- **Optional**: Subject heading authority (LCSH, Sears, or custom thesaurus)
- **Optional**: MARC-compatible cataloging software (Koha, Evergreen, LibraryThing)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose the Classification System

Select a system that matches the collection's size, scope, and audience.

```
Classification System Comparison:
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Criterion                  | Dewey Decimal (DDC)           | Library of Congress (LCC)     |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Best for                   | Public/school libraries,      | Academic/research libraries,  |
|                            | personal collections <10K     | collections >10K volumes      |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Structure                  | 10 main classes (000-999),    | 21 letter classes (A-Z),      |
|                            | decimal subdivision           | alphanumeric subdivision      |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Granularity                | Broad at top levels,          | Very specific; designed for   |
|                            | expandable via decimals       | research-level distinction    |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Learning curve             | Moderate — intuitive          | Steeper — requires schedules  |
|                            | decimal logic                 | and tables                    |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Browsability               | Excellent for general         | Excellent for subject-deep    |
|                            | browsing                      | collections                   |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

Decision Rule:
- Personal or small community library: DDC
- Academic, research, or large institutional: LCC
- Mixed or uncertain: Start with DDC; migrate to LCC if collection exceeds 10K
```

**Expected:** A classification system chosen that fits the collection's scale and purpose.

**On failure:** If neither system fits (e.g., a highly specialized archive), consider a faceted classification or custom scheme, but document the mapping to DDC or LCC for interoperability.

### Step 2: Perform Descriptive Cataloging

Create a bibliographic description for each item following standard practice.

```
Descriptive Cataloging Elements (RDA-aligned):
1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
   - Title proper (exactly as on title page)
   - Subtitle (if present)
   - Statement of responsibility (author, editor, translator)

2. EDITION
   - Edition statement ("2nd ed.", "Rev. ed.")

3. PUBLICATION INFORMATION
   - Place of publication
   - Publisher name
   - Date of publication

4. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
   - Extent (pages, volumes, running time)
   - Dimensions (cm for books)
   - Accompanying material (CD, maps)

5. SERIES
   - Series title and numbering

6. NOTES
   - Bibliography, index, language notes
   - Special features or provenance

7. STANDARD IDENTIFIERS
   - ISBN, ISSN, LCCN, OCLC number

Cataloging Principle: Describe what you see.
Take information from the item itself (title page first,
then cover, colophon, verso). Do not guess or embellish.
```

**Expected:** A consistent bibliographic record for each item with enough detail for unique identification and discovery.

**On failure:** If publication information is missing (common in older or self-published works), use square brackets to indicate supplied information: `[ca. 1920]`, `[s.l.]` (no place), `[s.n.]` (no publisher).

### Step 3: Assign Subject Headings

Apply controlled vocabulary terms so users can find materials by topic.

```
Subject Heading Sources:
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Authority                    | Use For                                  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| LCSH (Library of Congress    | General and academic collections.        |
| Subject Headings)            | Most widely used worldwide.              |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Sears List of Subject        | Small public and school libraries.       |
| Headings                     | Simpler vocabulary than LCSH.            |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| MeSH (Medical Subject        | Medical and health science collections.  |
| Headings)                    |                                          |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Custom thesaurus             | Specialized archives or corporate        |
|                              | collections with domain-specific terms.  |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Assignment Rules:
1. Assign 1-3 subject headings per item (more is noise, fewer is loss)
2. Use the most specific heading available (not "Science" when
   "Marine Biology" exists)
3. Apply subdivisions where helpful:
   - Topical: "Cooking--Italian"
   - Geographic: "Architecture--France--Paris"
   - Chronological: "Art--20th century"
   - Form: "Poetry--Collections"
4. Check authority files for preferred forms before creating new headings
5. Be consistent: if you use "Automobiles" don't also use "Cars" as a heading
```

**Expected:** Each item has 1-3 subject headings from a controlled vocabulary, applied consistently across the collection.

**On failure:** If no suitable heading exists in your authority, create a local heading and document it in a local authority file. Review periodically for alignment with the main authority.

### Step 4: Assign Call Numbers

Build the shelf address using the chosen classification system.

```
Dewey Decimal Call Number Construction:
1. Main class number (3 digits minimum): 641.5
2. Add Cutter number for author: .S65 (Smith)
3. Add date for editions: 2023
   Result: 641.5 S65 2023

DDC Main Classes:
  000 - Computer Science, Information
  100 - Philosophy, Psychology
  200 - Religion
  300 - Social Sciences
  400 - Language
  500 - Science
  600 - Technology
  700 - Arts, Recreation
  800 - Literature
  900 - History, Geography

LCC Call Number Construction:
1. Class letter(s): QA (Mathematics)
2. Subclass number: 76.73 (Programming languages)
3. Cutter for specific topic: .P98 (Python)
4. Date: 2023
   Result: QA76.73.P98 2023

Shelving Rule: Call numbers sort left-to-right,
segment by segment. Numbers sort numerically,
letters sort alphabetically, Cutters sort as decimals.
```

**Expected:** Every cataloged item has a unique call number that determines its shelf position.

**On failure:** If two items generate the same call number, add a work mark (first letter of title, excluding articles) or a copy number to disambiguate.

### Step 5: Create or Update Catalog Records

Enter the cataloged information into your catalog system.

```
Minimum Viable Catalog Record:
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Field           | Example                                      |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Call Number     | 641.5 S65 2023                               |
| Title           | The Joy of Cooking                           |
| Author          | Smith, Jane                                  |
| Edition         | 9th ed.                                      |
| Publisher       | New York : Scribner, 2023                    |
| Physical Desc.  | xii, 1200 p. : ill. ; 26 cm                 |
| ISBN            | 978-1-5011-6971-7                            |
| Subjects        | Cooking, American                            |
|                 | Cookbooks                                    |
| Status          | Available                                    |
| Location        | Main Stacks                                  |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------+

If using MARC format:
- 245 $a Title $c Statement of responsibility
- 100 $a Author (personal name)
- 050 $a LCC call number
- 082 $a DDC call number
- 650 $a Subject headings
- 020 $a ISBN

Copy cataloging: Check OCLC WorldCat or your library system's
shared database before creating original records. Someone has
likely already cataloged the same edition.
```

**Expected:** Each item has a catalog record in the system with all required fields populated. Records are searchable by author, title, subject, and call number.

**On failure:** If cataloging software is unavailable, a well-structured spreadsheet (with consistent column headings matching the fields above) serves as a functional catalog. Migrate to proper software when available.

### Step 6: Organize the Physical Shelf

Arrange materials according to their call numbers.

```
Shelf Organization Principles:
1. Left to right, top to bottom (like reading a page)
2. Call numbers in strict sort order:
   - DDC: 000 → 999, then Cutter alphabetically
   - LCC: A → Z, then number, then Cutter
3. Spine labels: print or write call number on spine label
   (white label, black text, 3 lines max)
4. Shelf markers: place dividers at major class boundaries
   (every 100 in DDC, every letter in LCC)
5. Shifting: leave 20-30% empty space per shelf for growth
6. Oversize: shelve items taller than 30cm in a separate
   oversize section, with "+q" prefix on call number

Shelf Reading (periodic verification):
- Walk the stacks weekly
- Check that items are in correct call number order
- Reshelve any misplaced items
- Note damaged items for repair or replacement
```

**Expected:** Materials are physically arranged in call number order with clear spine labels and growth space.

**On failure:** If space is insufficient, prioritize high-circulation items on accessible shelves and move low-use items to compact storage, noting the location change in catalog records.

## Validation

- [ ] Classification system chosen and documented
- [ ] Descriptive cataloging completed for all items with title, author, and publication data
- [ ] Subject headings assigned from a controlled vocabulary (1-3 per item)
- [ ] Call numbers assigned and unique for each item
- [ ] Catalog records created in system or spreadsheet
- [ ] Physical materials shelved in call number order with spine labels
- [ ] Authority control established for consistent name and subject forms

## Common Pitfalls

- **Inconsistent headings**: Using both "World War, 1939-1945" and "WWII" defeats the purpose of controlled vocabulary. Pick one authority and stick to it
- **Over-classification**: Assigning a 15-digit DDC number to a small personal library adds complexity without benefit. Match granularity to collection size
- **Ignoring copy cataloging**: Creating original records when copy records exist wastes time. Always check shared databases first
- **Spine label neglect**: A cataloged book without a spine label will be misshelved. Label immediately after cataloging
- **No growth space**: Packing shelves to 100% capacity means every new acquisition triggers a chain of shifting. Leave room
