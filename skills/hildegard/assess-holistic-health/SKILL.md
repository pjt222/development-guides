# Assess Holistic Health

Evaluate health through Hildegard von Bingen's temperament system from *Causae et Curae*, assessing the four temperaments, elemental balance, and providing dietary and lifestyle recommendations.

## When to Use

- You want to understand your constitutional type (temperament) in Hildegardian terms
- You are experiencing imbalance (fatigue, irritability, digestive issues, mental fog) and need holistic guidance
- You need dietary recommendations based on temperament
- You are integrating Hildegard's health principles into a wellness practice
- You want to understand the relationship between temperament, elements, and health
- You are researching medieval humoral medicine

## Inputs

- **Required**: Current symptoms or health concerns (physical, mental, emotional)
- **Required**: Responses to temperament assessment questions (constitution, habits, preferences)
- **Optional**: Age, sex, and general health history (for context)
- **Optional**: Current season (for seasonal adjustment recommendations)
- **Optional**: Existing dietary restrictions or preferences
- **Optional**: Known temperament from previous assessment

## Procedure

### Step 1: Temperament Assessment

Determine the dominant temperament through observation and structured questions.

The Four Temperaments in Causae et Curae:
┌──────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Temperament  │ Element  │ Qualities  │ Physiology  │ Psychology   │
├──────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ SANGUINE     │ Air      │ Hot, Moist │ Ruddy face, │ Cheerful,    │
│              │          │            │ plump build,│ sociable,    │
│              │          │            │ good sleep  │ optimistic   │
├──────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ CHOLERIC     │ Fire     │ Hot, Dry   │ Lean, wiry, │ Ambitious,   │
│              │          │            │ quick pulse,│ irritable,   │
│              │          │            │ warm skin   │ decisive     │
├──────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤

│              │          │            │ skin, heavy │ apathetic,   │
│              │          │            │ build       │ easygoing    │
└──────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘

Assessment Questions (score 0-3 per statement: 0=never, 1=rarely, 2=often, 3=always):

SANGUINE (Air):
[ ] I am naturally optimistic and sociable
[ ] I have a ruddy complexion and rarely feel cold
[ ] I sleep well and wake refreshed
[ ] I enjoy variety and new experiences
[ ] I gain weight easily but can also lose it
TOTAL: ___/15

CHOLERIC (Fire):
[ ] I am driven, goal-oriented, and impatient with delays
[ ] I have a lean build and high metabolism
[ ] I run warm and prefer cool environments
[ ] I make quick decisions and am often irritated by slowness
[ ] I have strong digestion and rarely feel cold
TOTAL: ___/15

MELANCHOLIC (Earth):
[ ] I am introspective, analytical, and prone to worry
[ ] I have a thin frame and struggle to gain weight
[ ] I feel cold easily and prefer warm environments
[ ] I am detail-oriented and perfectionistic
[ ] I have irregular digestion (constipation or sluggishness)
TOTAL: ___/15

PHLEGMATIC (Water):
[ ] I am calm, easygoing, and avoid conflict
[ ] I have a soft, pale complexion and retain water easily
[ ] I sleep long hours and still feel tired
[ ] I move slowly and prefer routine
[ ] I have slow digestion and feel heavy after meals
TOTAL: ___/15

Scoring:
- Dominant: Highest score (usually 9-15)
- Secondary: Second highest (usually 6-9)
- Most people are a blend of 1-2 temperaments
- Scores within 2-3 points indicate balanced type (rare)
```

**Expected:** Dominant and secondary temperament identified, with score profile showing primary constitutional tendencies.

**On failure:** If all scores are within 2-3 points of each other, the person has a balanced temperament (unusual in Hildegard's system). Proceed with general recommendations avoiding extremes (no very hot or very cold foods).

### Step 2: Elemental Balance Assessment

Evaluate whether the current state reflects excess, deficiency, or balance of elemental qualities.

```
Elemental Imbalance Patterns:
┌─────────────────┬────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Imbalance       │ Symptoms           │ Causation               │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ EXCESS AIR      │ Anxiety, gas,      │ Too much raw food,      │
│ (hot/moist)     │ scattered thoughts │ erratic schedule        │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ DEFICIENT AIR   │ Depression, rigid  │ Isolation, sedentary,   │
│                 │ thinking, isolation│ routine without joy     │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ EXCESS FIRE     │ Inflammation, acid │ Overwork, spicy foods,  │
│ (hot/dry)       │ reflux, anger      │ stimulants, summer heat │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ DEFICIENT FIRE  │ Cold extremities,  │ Sedentary, raw/cold     │
│                 │ low motivation,    │ foods, winter isolation │
│                 │ weak digestion     │                         │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ EXCESS EARTH    │ Stiffness, rigidity│ Overwork without rest,  │
│ (cold/dry)      │ constipation, fear │ dry foods, isolation    │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ DEFICIENT EARTH │ Ungrounded, flighty│ Lack of routine, travel,│
│                 │ anxious, diarrhea  │ insufficient protein    │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ EXCESS WATER    │ Edema, lethargy,   │ Sedentary, cold/damp    │
│ (cold/moist)    │ mucus, depression  │ foods, damp environment │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ DEFICIENT WATER │ Dry skin/mucous,   │ Dehydration, hot/dry    │
│                 │ hard stools, thirst│ climate, excess heat    │
└─────────────────┴────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

Assessment:
1. Match current symptoms to imbalance patterns
2. Consider season: Winter increases cold/dry (earth), Summer increases hot/dry (fire)
3. Note recent life changes: Travel, stress, diet shifts, illness
4. Determine if imbalance is acute (recent onset) or chronic (longstanding pattern)
```

**Expected:** Identification of 1-2 elemental imbalances (e.g., "Excess water with deficient fire" = cold/damp pattern with low vitality).

**On failure:** If symptom pattern is unclear or contradictory, default to the opposite qualities of the dominant temperament. Example: Choleric (hot/dry) feeling unwell likely has excess fire → recommend cooling/moistening.

### Step 3: Dietary Recommendations

Prescribe foods to rebalance elemental excess or deficiency, following Hildegard's *Physica* and *Causae et Curae*.

```
Hildegard's Dietary Principles:

FOODS BY ELEMENTAL QUALITY:
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Quality      │ Foods                                      │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WARMING      │ Spelt, fennel, ginger, galangal, cinnamon, │
│              │ nutmeg, lamb, chestnuts, cooked vegetables │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ COOLING      │ Lettuce, cucumber, pears, plums, barley,   │
│              │ fish, raw salads, diluted wine             │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ MOISTENING   │ Butter, cream, honey, figs, grapes, wine,  │
│              │ soups, stews, broths                       │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ DRYING       │ Rye, beans, lentils, roasted meats,        │
│              │ nuts (in moderation), aged cheese          │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────┘

TEMPERAMENT-SPECIFIC DIETARY GUIDELINES:

SANGUINE (Air — Hot/Moist) — Generally Balanced:
- Maintain variety, avoid dietary extremes
- Favor: Whole grains (spelt, oats), balanced proteins, vegetables
- Moderate: Rich foods, sweets (tend toward weight gain)
- Avoid: Excessive cold or excessively hot foods

CHOLERIC (Fire — Hot/Dry) — Cooling/Moistening Diet:
- Cool the fire, prevent inflammation and irritability
- Favor: Lettuce, cucumber, pears, fish, barley, diluted wine
- Moderate: Lamb, roasted meats, aged cheese
- Avoid: Spicy foods, garlic (raw), strong wine, overeating meat

MELANCHOLIC (Earth — Cold/Dry) — Warming/Moistening Diet:
- Warm the constitution, ease constipation and fear
- Favor: Spelt, fennel, ginger, cooked vegetables, soups, butter
- Moderate: Raw foods, salads (only in summer)
- Avoid: Rye, beans, cold foods, fasting

PHLEGMATIC (Water — Cold/Moist) — Warming/Drying Diet:
- Dry the dampness, increase vitality and motivation
- Favor: Spelt, chestnuts, roasted meats, ginger, galangal, nutmeg
- Moderate: Dairy, sweet fruits, wine
- Avoid: Cold foods, raw salads, excess liquids, pork

SPELT (Dinkel) — Hildegard's Universal Grain:
"Spelt is the best grain. It is warm, nourishing, and strong.
Whoever eats it has good flesh and blood, a happy mind, and a joyful spirit."
(*Physica*, Book I, Chapter 2)
- Recommended for ALL temperaments as foundation grain
- Superior to wheat, which Hildegard considered inferior

GALANGAL — Universal Digestive Spice:
"Let one who has pain in the heart or who has become weak in the heart
eat galangal, and he will be restored to health."
(*Physica*, Book I, Chapter 157)
- Warming, stimulating, heart-supporting
- Especially for melancholic and phlegmatic types
```

**Expected:** Specific food recommendations tailored to temperament and current imbalance, with clear "favor/moderate/avoid" categories.

**On failure:** If dietary restrictions prevent following recommendations (e.g., vegetarian unable to eat lamb), substitute within the same elemental category (warming/cooling/moistening/drying). Consult the plant-based options within each category.

### Step 4: Lifestyle and Seasonal Adjustments

Recommend non-dietary practices to support rebalancing: sleep, movement, prayer, seasonal rhythms.

```
Lifestyle Recommendations by Imbalance:

EXCESS AIR (scattered, anxious):
- Practice grounding: barefoot walking, gardening, repetitive handwork
- Reduce stimulation: Limit news, social media, multitasking
- Routine: Regular meal and sleep times
- Meditation: Breath-focused (shamatha), body scan

DEFICIENT AIR (depressed, isolated):
- Social engagement: Community, conversation, singing
- Variety: New experiences, travel, learning
- Movement: Dance, walks in nature (not isolated exercise)
- Meditation: Loving-kindness (metta), gratitude practice

EXCESS FIRE (inflammation, anger):
- Cooling practices: Swim, evening walks, avoid midday sun
- Rest: Prioritize sleep, avoid overwork
- Prayer/Meditation: Contemplative, slow-paced, non-goal-oriented
- Avoid: Competitive exercise, heated arguments, stimulants

DEFICIENT FIRE (cold, unmotivated):
- Warming practices: Morning sun exposure, moderate exercise, warming baths
- Challenge: Set achievable goals, take on new projects
- Social: Engage with energetic, positive people
- Movement: Brisk walking, dancing, labor

EXCESS EARTH (rigid, constipated):
- Flexibility: Yoga, stretching, massage
- Creativity: Art, music, play (non-structured)
- Moisture: Warm baths, soups, hydration
- Release: Journaling, confession, letting go of control

DEFICIENT EARTH (ungrounded, anxious):
- Grounding: Gardening, working with hands, routine
- Structure: Daily schedule, meal times, sleep rhythm
- Protein: Adequate protein at each meal
- Meditation: Walking meditation, mindful labor

EXCESS WATER (lethargic, damp):
- Movement: Daily exercise to promote circulation and sweating
- Warmth: Sauna, hot baths, warm clothing, avoid damp environments
- Stimulation: Engage with challenging tasks, avoid excessive rest
- Rhythm: Wake early, avoid napping

DEFICIENT WATER (dry, rigid):
- Hydration: Adequate water, broths, herbal teas
- Rest: Prioritize sleep, reduce activity if overworked
- Moisture: Humidifier in dry climates, oil massage
- Ease: Release pressure, practice self-compassion

SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS (all temperaments):
- Spring (Air rising): Light diet, cleansing herbs, outdoor activity
- Summer (Fire peak): Cooling foods, swim, rest in heat of day
- Autumn (Earth settling): Harvest foods, prepare for winter, grounding practices
- Winter (Water depth): Warming foods, rest more, contemplation, less activity
```

**Expected:** 3-5 specific lifestyle recommendations that address the identified imbalance and align with Hildegard's holistic view (body, mind, spirit, nature).

**On failure:** If recommendations feel overwhelming, prioritize ONE dietary change and ONE lifestyle change to begin. Full rebalancing takes weeks to months — start small.

### Step 5: Integration and Monitoring

Provide timeline, monitoring guidelines, and when to reassess.

```
Integration Protocol:
Week 1-2: Implement dietary changes gradually
- Replace 1-2 meals per day with temperament-appropriate foods
- Avoid abrupt elimination (can cause stress/imbalance)
- Note energy, digestion, sleep quality, mood daily

Week 3-4: Add lifestyle practices
- Choose 1-2 lifestyle recommendations to integrate
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Continue dietary changes; they should feel habitual by now

Week 5-8: Assess progress
- Are original symptoms improving?
- Has energy/mood shifted?
- Any new imbalances emerging? (Sometimes correcting one reveals another)

Reassessment Triggers:
- No improvement after 4 weeks → Reassess temperament; may have misidentified
- Partial improvement → Continue current plan, allow more time (8-12 weeks)
- New symptoms → Overcorrection possible; reduce intensity of interventions
- Seasonal change → Adjust foods/practices for new season

Long-Term Practice:
Hildegard's system is preventive and lifelong. The goal is not to "fix" and return
to old habits, but to develop a sustainable, temperament-harmonious way of living.
```

**Expected:** User has clear timeline for change implementation, monitoring practices, and criteria for reassessment.

**On failure:** If user reports feeling worse after 1-2 weeks, reassess for overcorrection. Example: Adding too many warming foods to a choleric type could cause excess fire. Dial back to neutral foods temporarily.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Temperament assessment completed with dominant and secondary types identified
- [ ] Elemental imbalance(s) identified (excess/deficiency of air/fire/earth/water)
- [ ] Dietary recommendations provided with "favor/moderate/avoid" categories
- [ ] Spelt and galangal (Hildegard's universals) included unless contraindicated
- [ ] Lifestyle recommendations address imbalance (grounding, cooling, stimulating, etc.)
- [ ] Seasonal adjustments noted if applicable
- [ ] Integration timeline provided (weeks 1-2, 3-4, 5-8)
- [ ] Monitoring and reassessment triggers documented
- [ ] User informed this is holistic guidance, not medical diagnosis

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Rigid Type-Casting**: Most people are blends. Don't force a single temperament identity
2. **Ignoring Season**: Winter melancholic needs different foods than summer melancholic
3. **Overcorrecting**: Adding excessive opposite qualities can create new imbalance. Go gradually
4. **Modern Food Confusion**: Hildegard's foods reflect 12th-century European diet. Adapt to available foods with same elemental qualities
5. **Expecting Fast Results**: Temperament is constitutional; rebalancing takes weeks to months
6. **Isolating Diet**: Hildegard's system is holistic. Diet alone without lifestyle/spiritual integration is incomplete
7. **Neglecting Spiritual Component**: *Causae et Curae* integrates body and soul. Prayer, meditation, and virtue are part of health
