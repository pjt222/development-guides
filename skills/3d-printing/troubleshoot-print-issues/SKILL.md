# Troubleshoot Print Issues

Diagnose and fix common 3D printing failures using systematic symptom analysis. This skill covers the most frequent FDM and SLA issues: poor bed adhesion, stringing, layer shifts, warping, under-extrusion, over-extrusion, and print quality defects. Uses a structured approach of symptom identification, root cause analysis, and iterative fixes.

## When to Use

- Print fails during first layer or partway through
- Finished prints have quality defects (stringing, blobs, gaps, rough surfaces)
- Dimensional accuracy problems (over/undersized, warping, elephant foot)
- Layer adhesion issues (delamination, splitting)
- Support removal leaves damage or supports fail during print
- Prints look different from slicer preview
- Material behaves inconsistently across prints
- New material, printer, or environmental conditions causing issues

## Inputs

- **failure_description**: What went wrong (failed first layer, stringing, warping, etc.)
- **failure_timing**: When issue occurs (first layer, midprint, specific height, top layers)
- **material**: Filament/resin type, brand, age, storage conditions
- **printer**: Make/model, nozzle size, bed type, enclosure
- **recent_changes**: New material, slicer settings, hardware modifications, environment
- **print_history**: Does this model usually work? Did this material work before?

## Procedure

### 1. Collect Failure Symptoms

Document observable symptoms with specificity:

**Visual inspection**:
- Take photos of failure (overall, close-up, specific defect)
- Note failure location (first layer, specific height, top surface)
- Describe defect type: gaps, blobs, strings, shifts, cracks

**Environmental data**:
- Ambient temperature during print
- Humidity level
- Drafts or AC affecting printer
- Time of day (temperature changes)

**Print parameters**:
```bash
# Extract from G-code metadata
grep "^;MAXX\|^;MINX\|^;MAXZ" failed_print.gcode  # Print dimensions
grep "^;PRINT_TIME:" failed_print.gcode  # Estimated time
grep "^M104\|^M140" failed_print.gcode | head -5  # Temperatures
grep "^;generated by" failed_print.gcode  # Slicer version
```

**Expected**: Detailed symptom description with photos, parameters, and environmental context.

**On failure**: If symptoms unclear, print a calibration test (temperature tower, stringing test, or benchy) to reproduce and observe failure systematically.

### 2. Classify Issue by Symptom Pattern

Match observed symptoms to common failure modes:

## Diagnostic Reference Table

| Symptom | Likely Causes | Quick Check | Priority Fix |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Poor bed adhesion** | Dirty bed, wrong temp, too high Z | Wipe bed, level bed | Clean bed, adjust Z-offset down 0.05mm |
| **Stringing** | Too hot, insufficient retraction | Check nozzle temp | Lower temp 5°C, increase retraction +0.5mm |
| **Layer shifts** | Loose belts, too fast, collision | Check belt tension | Tighten belts, reduce speed 20% |
| **Warping** | Poor adhesion, fast cooling | Check corners lifting | Add brim, enclose printer, increase bed temp |
| **Under-extrusion** | Clog, low temp, wrong flow | Check extrusion consistency | Clean nozzle, increase temp 5°C, calibrate e-steps |
| **Over-extrusion** | High flow rate, wrong e-steps | Check blob formation | Reduce flow 2-5%, calibrate e-steps |
| **Elephant foot** | First layer squish, bed too hot | Measure base width | Raise Z-offset +0.05mm, lower bed temp 5°C |
| **Gaps in walls** | Thin walls, under-extrusion | Check wall thickness | Enable thin wall detection, increase flow |
| **Layer delamination** | Low temp, poor cooling, contamination | Check layer lines | Increase temp 5-10°C, check wet filament |
| **Blobs/zits** | Retraction, coast settings | Check seam alignment | Tune retraction, enable coasting |
| **Rough top surface** | Insufficient top layers, ironing | Count solid top layers | Add 2 top layers, enable ironing |
| **Sagging overhangs** | Insufficient cooling, too hot | Check part cooling fan | Increase cooling, lower temp, add supports |

**Expected**: Failure classified into 1-3 most likely categories.

**On failure**: If symptoms match multiple categories, prioritize based on failure timing (first layer issues first, then midprint, then top surface).

### 3. Perform Root Cause Analysis

Investigate underlying cause, not just symptoms:

**5 Whys technique**:
```
Symptom: Print warping and lifting from bed
Why? → Poor bed adhesion in corners
Why? → Corners cooling faster than center
Why? → Room draft from AC vent
Why? → No enclosure to maintain stable temperature
Why? → ABS requires heated chamber for uniform cooling

Root cause: Material choice (ABS) incompatible with open printer in drafty room
```

**Common root causes by category**:

**Mechanical**:
- Loose belts, pulleys, or set screws
- Worn/dirty linear bearings or rods
- Z-axis binding or misalignment
- Extruder gear worn or skipping

**Thermal**:
- Temperature sensor drift or failure
- Inadequate heated bed power/insulation
- Insufficient part cooling
- Environmental temperature swings

**Material**:
- Wet filament (hygroscopic materials)
- Old/degraded material
- Contaminated filament (dust, oils)
- Wrong material for application

**Configuration**:
- Incorrect e-steps calibration
- Wrong flow rate multiplier
- Slicer bug or wrong profile
- Firmware acceleration/jerk too high

**Expected**: Root cause identified with supporting evidence (measured temperatures, belt tension, visual inspection).

**On failure**: If root cause unclear, use elimination method: fix most likely cause, re-test, repeat until resolved.

### 4. Apply First-Level Fixes

Implement immediate solutions for common issues:

### Poor Bed Adhesion

**Immediate fixes**:
```bash
# 1. Clean bed thoroughly
# Glass/PEI: Isopropyl alcohol 90%+
# BuildTak: Warm water and dish soap

# 2. Level bed (paper test at 4 corners + center)
# Paper should drag slightly

# 3. Adjust Z-offset down (squish first layer more)
# Start: -0.05mm increments until lines fuse

# 4. Increase bed temperature +5°C

# 5. Add adhesion aid:
# - Glue stick (PLA/PETG)
# - Hairspray (ABS)
# - ABS juice (ABS) - ABS dissolved in acetone
# - Magigoo/3D printing adhesive
```

**Slicer settings**:
- First layer height: 0.2-0.3mm (thicker = better squish)
- First layer speed: 20mm/s (slower = better adhesion)
- Add brim: 8-10mm for small footprint parts
- Add raft: For very difficult materials (TPU, Nylon)

**Expected**: First layer adheres completely with no lifting.

**On failure**: Check bed flatness with feeler gauge or mesh leveling; warped bed requires glass/PEI sheet or mesh compensation.

### Stringing

**Temperature-first approach**:
```
1. Print temperature tower (180-220°C in 5° steps for PLA)
2. Identify lowest temperature that extrudes cleanly
3. Use that temperature -5°C to minimize stringing
```

**Retraction tuning**:
```yaml
# Direct drive extruder:
retraction_distance: 1.0-2.0mm
retraction_speed: 40-50mm/s

# Bowden extruder:
retraction_distance: 4.0-6.0mm
retraction_speed: 40-60mm/s

# If stringing persists:
- Enable z-hop: 0.2-0.4mm (lifts nozzle during travel)
- Reduce travel speed (paradoxically helps)
- Enable combing mode (travels within infill)
```

**Expected**: Minimal stringing, thin strings easily removed by hand.

**On failure**: Check for nozzle partial clog or wet filament (both cause oozing).

### Layer Shifts

**Mechanical checks**:
```bash
# 1. Check belt tension (should twang like guitar string)
# Tighten if loose

# 2. Check pulley set screws (motor shafts)
# Must align with flat on motor shaft

# 3. Check for mechanical resistance
# Manually move X/Y axes - should glide smoothly
# Binding indicates dirty rods, worn bearings, or misalignment

# 4. Check stepper motor current (advanced)
# Too low → skipping; too high → overheating
```

**Speed reduction**:
```yaml
# Reduce these speeds:
perimeter_speed: 40mm/s (from 50)
travel_speed: 120mm/s (from 150)
acceleration: 500mm/s² (from 1000)
jerk: 8mm/s (from 15)
```

**Expected**: No layer shifts in re-print with tightened belts and reduced speeds.

**On failure**: Check for slicer-generated collisions (part cooling fan hitting model) or electrical issues (stepper driver overheating).

### Warping

**Thermal management**:
```yaml
# Increase bed temperature:
PLA: 60°C → 65°C
PETG: 80°C → 85°C
ABS: 100°C → 110°C

# Disable/reduce part cooling:
first_layer_fan: 0%
regular_fan: 25% max (ABS), 50% (PETG), 100% (PLA)

# Enclose printer (critical for ABS/ASA):
- Cardboard box (temporary)
- Acrylic panels (permanent)
- Target chamber temp: 40-50°C
```

**Adhesion enhancement**:
- Add brim: 10-15mm for corners
- Add "mouse ears": 15mm diameter discs at sharp corners
- Chamfer bottom edges in model (45° × 1mm removes stress concentrator)

**Expected**: Part stays flat with no corner lifting.

**On failure**: Material fundamentally unsuitable for printer (ABS on unenclosed printer)—switch to PETG or ASA.

### Under-Extrusion

**Quick fixes**:
```bash
# 1. Check for nozzle clog
# Heat to print temp, manually push filament
# Should extrude smoothly

# 2. Cold pull cleaning (if partial clog)
# Heat to 220°C, push cleaning filament through
# Cool to 90°C, pull sharply - should remove debris

# 3. Increase temperature +5-10°C
# Higher temp = better flow

# 4. Increase flow rate 2-5%
# Slicer: Filament settings → Flow → 102-105%
```

**E-steps calibration**:
```bash
# 1. Mark filament 120mm above extruder
# 2. Extrude 100mm: G1 E100 F100
# 3. Measure remaining distance to mark
# 4. Calculate: new_steps = current_steps × (100 / actual_extruded)
# 5. Set: M92 E<new_steps>; M500 (save to EEPROM)
```

**Expected**: Consistent extrusion with no gaps in perimeters or infill.

**On failure**: Check for heat creep (cooling fan failure), worn extruder gear, or cracked extruder arm.

### Over-Extrusion

**Flow rate reduction**:
```yaml
# Reduce flow in 2% increments:
extrusion_multiplier: 0.98 → 0.96 → 0.94

# Signs of correct flow:
- Smooth top surface (not overstuffed)
- Perimeters don't bulge outward
- Infill doesn't overfill and push layers apart
```

**Dimensional accuracy test**:
```bash
# Print 20mm calibration cube
# Measure with calipers:
# X/Y dimensions should be 20.0mm ± 0.1mm
# If consistently oversized → reduce flow
# If undersized → increase flow
```

**Expected**: Accurate dimensions, smooth surfaces, no bulging.

**On failure**: Re-calibrate e-steps (may be set too high).

### 5. Verify Fix with Test Print

Confirm resolution before attempting full print:

**Test print selection**:
- **Adhesion issues**: 20mm square × 5 layers (fast first layer test)
- **Stringing**: Stringing test model (dual towers with travels)
- **Layer shifts**: Tall thin test (stress mechanical system)
- **Warping**: Large flat surface (200mm × 200mm × 0.4mm)
- **Extrusion**: 20mm calibration cube (dimensional accuracy)

**Expected**: Test print succeeds with issue resolved.

**On failure**: If test fails, issue not fully resolved or multiple issues present—repeat diagnosis focusing on remaining symptoms.

### 6. Document Solution

Record successful fix for future reference:

**Issue log template**:
```yaml
date: 2026-02-16
issue: "Layer shifts at 50mm height"
symptoms: "X-axis shifts 10mm, happens consistently at same height"
printer: "Ender 3 V2"
material: "PETG, PolyMaker PolyLite"
root_cause: "Loose X-axis belt, pulley set screw not on flat"
solution:
  - "Tightened X-axis belt to 120Hz resonance"
  - "Realigned pulley set screw on motor shaft flat"
  - "Reduced print speed to 40mm/s perimeter"
verification: "Printed 100mm test cylinder - no shifts"
notes: "Check belt tension monthly, pulley tends to slip"
```

**Expected**: Issue documented with root cause and solution for knowledge base.

**On failure**: Even unsuccessful troubleshooting attempts should be logged to avoid repeating failed solutions.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Failure symptoms documented with photos and specific observations
- [ ] Issue classified using diagnostic reference table
- [ ] Root cause identified (mechanical, thermal, material, or configuration)
- [ ] Appropriate fix applied based on root cause category
- [ ] Fix verified with test print before attempting full print
- [ ] Solution documented in issue log with date, cause, and resolution
- [ ] Environmental factors recorded (temperature, humidity, drafts)
- [ ] Material condition checked (dry, contamination-free, stored properly)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Changing multiple variables**: Adjust one parameter at a time; otherwise you won't know what fixed it (or made it worse)
2. **Ignoring wet filament**: Hygroscopic materials (Nylon, TPU, PETG) absorb moisture causing bubbling, stringing, poor adhesion—always suspect wet filament first
3. **Skipping mechanical checks**: Loose belts and worn components cause issues no amount of slicer tuning can fix
4. **Temperature from internet**: Every printer/material combination is unique—always run your own temperature tower
5. **Over-tightening belts**: Too tight = premature bearing wear; aim for guitar string tension, not steel cable
6. **Blaming slicer**: Slicer bugs are rare; 95% of issues are mechanical, thermal, or material-related
7. **Not cleaning nozzle**: Partial clogs cause intermittent under-extrusion that looks like flow/e-step issues
8. **Assuming bed is level**: Beds warp over time, springs compress, and adjustments slip—re-level weekly for reliable results
9. **Wrong Z-offset**: Most first layer failures are Z-offset too high (not enough squish) or too low (nozzle scraping bed)
10. **Environmental neglect**: ABS/ASA in 15°C garage with drafts will never print well—material requires stable warm environment
