# ML/Data Science Review Team

A four-agent team that performs comprehensive review of machine learning and data science projects. The lead (senior-data-scientist) orchestrates parallel reviews across statistics, methodology, MLOps, and architecture, then synthesizes findings into a prioritized report.

## Purpose

ML and data science projects span multiple disciplines that benefit from specialized review perspectives:

- **Statistics**: Model selection, validation strategy, metric choice, bias-variance tradeoff, confidence intervals
- **Methodology**: Experimental design, hypothesis testing, sampling strategy, reproducibility, scientific rigor
- **MLOps**: Experiment tracking, model registry, feature stores, serving infrastructure, monitoring
- **Architecture**: Code quality, pipeline design, API surface, dependency management, scalability

By running these reviews in parallel, the team identifies issues that cross domain boundaries — such as a statistically sound model with poor production readiness.

## Team Composition

| Member | Agent | Role | Focus Areas |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| Lead | `senior-data-scientist` | Lead | Statistics, model validation, final synthesis |
| Methodology | `senior-researcher` | Methodology Reviewer | Experimental design, hypothesis testing, reproducibility |
| MLOps | `mlops-engineer` | MLOps Reviewer | Tracking, registry, serving, drift monitoring |
| Architecture | `senior-software-developer` | Architecture Reviewer | Code structure, pipelines, APIs, tech debt |

## Coordination Pattern

Hub-and-spoke: the senior-data-scientist lead scopes the project, distributes review tasks, each reviewer works independently, and the lead synthesizes all findings.

```
       senior-data-scientist (Lead)
          /       |        \
         /        |         \
senior-researcher  |  senior-software-developer
                  |
          mlops-engineer
```

**Flow:**

1. Lead identifies the project scope, key models, and data pipelines
2. Three reviewers work in parallel on their specialties
3. Lead collects all findings and identifies cross-domain issues
4. Lead produces a prioritized report with actionable recommendations

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 1: Setup (Lead)
The senior-data-scientist lead examines the project and creates targeted review tasks:

- Identify key models, datasets, and evaluation metrics
- Map the data pipeline from ingestion to serving
- Create review tasks scoped to each reviewer's specialty
- Note project-specific concerns (e.g., real-time inference, regulatory constraints)

### Phase 2: Parallel Review

**senior-researcher** tasks:
- Evaluate experimental design and hypothesis formulation
- Review sampling strategy and data splitting methodology
- Assess reproducibility (random seeds, environment pinning, data versioning)
- Check scientific writing quality in notebooks and documentation

**mlops-engineer** tasks:
- Evaluate experiment tracking setup (MLflow, W&B, or similar)
- Review model registry and versioning practices
- Assess feature store usage and feature engineering pipeline
- Check serving infrastructure and drift monitoring readiness

**senior-software-developer** tasks:
- Review code structure and modularity
- Evaluate data pipeline design patterns
- Assess API design for model serving endpoints
- Check dependency management and technical debt

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Lead)
The senior-data-scientist lead:
- Collects all reviewer findings
- Reviews statistical methods and model validation in detail
- Identifies cross-domain issues (e.g., sound statistics but undeployable model)
- Produces a prioritized report: critical > high > medium > low
- Recommends specific improvements for each finding

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Model Review Before Production
Reviewing an ML model before deploying to production:

```
User: Review our churn prediction model before we deploy — check the statistics, methodology, and production readiness
```

The team validates statistical soundness, experimental rigor, MLOps readiness, and code quality before deployment.

### Scenario 2: Data Science Project Audit
Auditing an existing data science project for quality:

```
User: Audit our recommendation engine project — we need to know if the methodology is sound and the code is maintainable
```

The team provides comprehensive assessment across all four dimensions with prioritized improvement recommendations.

### Scenario 3: Notebook-to-Production Migration
Reviewing a project transitioning from notebooks to production:

```
User: We're moving our fraud detection model from Jupyter notebooks to a production pipeline — review the migration plan
```

The team evaluates the statistical integrity during migration, methodology preservation, MLOps infrastructure, and production architecture.

## Limitations

- Best suited for ML/data science projects; not designed for general software review
- Requires all four agent types to be available as subagents
- Does not execute model training or run experiments — focuses on code and design review
- Deep domain expertise (e.g., NLP-specific or computer vision-specific) depends on model documentation
- Large projects with many models may need scoped reviews per model
