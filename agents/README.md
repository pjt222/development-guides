# Agents Library for Claude Code

<!-- AUTO:START:agents-intro -->
A collection of 53 specialized agent definitions for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Each agent defines a persona with specific capabilities, tools, and domain expertise that Claude Code uses when spawned as a subagent.

All agents inherit **default skills**: meditate, heal.

## How Agents Differ from Skills and Guides

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Guides** (parent directory) | Human-readable reference docs | "R Package Development Best Practices" |
| **Agents** (this directory) | Personas with broad capabilities | "R Developer" agent |
| **Skills** (`skills/` directory) | Executable procedures for specific tasks | "Submit to CRAN" step-by-step |

Agents define *who* (persona, tools, style); skills define *how* (procedure, validation, recovery). They complement each other — an agent can reference skills to execute specific tasks.

<!-- AUTO:END:agents-table -->

Each agent lists the skills it can execute in its `skills` frontmatter field and `## Available Skills` section. The devops-engineer agent covers the most ground (35 skills across 5 domains). Together, the 29 agents cover 161 of the 177 skills in the library. The sixteen uncovered skills are the two meta-skills (`create-skill` and `evolve-skill`), the two visualization utilities (`create-skill-glyph`, `glyph-enhance`), the four AI meta-cognitive skills (`learn`, `teach`, `listen`, `observe`), the seven human-guidance skills (`heal-guidance`, `meditate-guidance`, `remote-viewing-guidance`, `learn-guidance`, `teach-guidance`, `listen-guidance`, `observe-guidance`), and the memory utility (`manage-memory`).

## Using Agents in Claude Code

### Automatic Discovery

Place agent files in `.claude/agents/` (project-level) or `~/.claude/agents/` (global). Claude Code discovers them automatically and makes them available as subagent types via the `Task` tool.

This repository's `.claude/agents/` symlinks to this directory, so agents are available when working in the development-guides project.

### Manual Reference

Reference agents in your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Agents
@development-guides/agents/r-developer.md
@development-guides/agents/code-reviewer.md
@development-guides/agents/security-analyst.md
```

Task(subagent_type="shiny-developer", prompt="Build a golem Shiny app with filter modules and deploy to shinyapps.io")
```

## Agent File Format

Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name           # kebab-case identifier
description: Brief purpose  # 1-2 sentences
tools: [Read, Write, ...]  # Required Claude Code tools
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
version: "1.0"
author: Author Name
tags: [domain, capability]
priority: normal            # low | normal | high | critical
skills: [skill-id, ...]    # Skills from skills/ this agent can execute
---
```

See [configuration-schema.md](configuration-schema.md) for the full schema and [_template.md](_template.md) for a starter template.

## Creating a New Agent

1. Copy `_template.md` to `<agent-name>.md`
2. Fill in the YAML frontmatter (all required fields)
3. Write the Purpose, Capabilities, Usage Scenarios, and Examples sections
4. Add the agent to `_registry.yml`
5. Update the table in this README

See [best-practices.md](best-practices.md) for detailed guidance on writing effective agents.

## Registry

`_registry.yml` provides machine-readable metadata for all agents. Keep it in sync when adding or removing agents.

## License
