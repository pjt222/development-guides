# ACP Developer Agent

An Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developer for building interoperable agent systems using Google's open A2A standard (now under the Linux Foundation). Covers Agent Card design, JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoints, task lifecycle management, streaming (SSE), push notifications, security (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect), and gRPC transport.

## Purpose

This agent implements the A2A protocol specification to enable structured communication between autonomous agents. While MCP connects AI assistants to tools and data, A2A connects agents to each other — enabling multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate on complex tasks through a standardized protocol.

## Capabilities

- **Agent Card Design**: Create `.well-known/agent.json` manifests describing agent capabilities, skills, and authentication requirements
- **JSON-RPC Endpoints**: Implement the core A2A methods: `tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, and `tasks/sendSubscribe`
- **Task Lifecycle**: Manage the full task state machine: submitted → working → input-required → completed/failed/canceled
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time task progress and partial results
- **Push Notifications**: Webhook-based notifications for long-running tasks
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication for agent-to-agent communication
- **Multi-Modal Content**: Handle text, files, images, and structured data in task messages via A2A Parts

## Available Skills

This agent can execute the following structured procedures from the [skills library](../skills/):

### A2A Protocol
- `design-a2a-agent-card` — Design an Agent Card manifest with capabilities, skills, and auth configuration
- `implement-a2a-server` — Implement a JSON-RPC 2.0 A2A server with task lifecycle management
- `test-a2a-interop` — Test A2A interoperability between agents with conformance validation

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create an A2A-Compliant Agent
Build a new agent that can be discovered and invoked by other A2A agents.

```
User: Make my code review bot A2A-compatible
Agent: [Runs design-a2a-agent-card procedure]
       1. Defines agent capabilities: code review, security scanning
       2. Specifies supported content types and max message sizes
       3. Creates .well-known/agent.json with skill descriptors
       [Runs implement-a2a-server procedure]
       4. Implements JSON-RPC endpoint for tasks/send
       5. Maps incoming tasks to existing review logic
       6. Returns structured review results as A2A artifacts
       7. Implements SSE streaming for progress updates
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration
Connect multiple specialized agents via A2A for a complex workflow.

```
User: Set up A2A communication between a research agent and a writing agent
Agent: [Runs design-a2a-agent-card procedure]
       1. Creates Agent Cards for both agents
       2. Defines shared skill taxonomy for task routing
       3. Configures push notifications for async handoff
       [Runs implement-a2a-server procedure]
       4. Implements task delegation from research → writing agent
       5. Handles the input-required state for clarification requests
       6. Manages artifact passing between agents
```

### Scenario 3: Interoperability Testing
Validate A2A conformance between agents from different implementations.

```
User: Test if my Python agent can communicate with the TypeScript reference agent
Agent: [Runs test-a2a-interop procedure]
       1. Fetches both Agent Cards and validates schema conformance
       2. Sends test tasks exercising all lifecycle states
       3. Validates SSE streaming responses
       4. Tests error handling (invalid tasks, timeouts, cancellation)
       5. Generates interoperability report with pass/fail per method
```

## A2A Protocol Overview

### Core Concepts
```
┌──────────────┐    JSON-RPC 2.0    ┌──────────────┐
│ Client Agent │ ──────────────────→ │ Server Agent │
│              │ ←── SSE/Response ── │              │
│              │                     │              │
│ Discovers    │    GET /.well-known │ Publishes    │
│ capabilities │ ←── /agent.json ──→ │ Agent Card   │
└──────────────┘                     └──────────────┘
```

### Task Lifecycle States
```
submitted → working → completed
                   → failed
                   → canceled
                   → input-required → working (after client responds)
```

### Agent Card Structure
```json
{
  "name": "Code Review Agent",
  "description": "Reviews code for quality, security, and style",
  "url": "https://agent.example.com",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": true,
    "pushNotifications": true
  },
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "review-code",
      "name": "Code Review",
      "description": "Review code changes for quality and security"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": {
    "schemes": ["oauth2"]
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
# A2A development preferences
settings:
  language: typescript        # typescript, python, go
  transport: http             # http, grpc
  streaming: sse              # sse, websocket (sse is standard)
  auth: oauth2                # none, oauth2, oidc, api_key
  port: 8080
```

## Tool Requirements

- **Required**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob (for implementation and testing)
- **Optional**: WebFetch (for Agent Card discovery and interoperability testing)
- **MCP Servers**: None required

## Best Practices

- **Agent Card First**: Design the Agent Card before implementation — it's the contract
- **Skill Granularity**: Define skills at the task level, not the function level
- **Handle All States**: Implement all task lifecycle transitions, especially error and cancellation
- **Stream Progress**: Use SSE for long-running tasks — clients need feedback
- **Secure by Default**: Always require authentication in production deployments
- **Version Carefully**: Agent Card changes affect all connected agents

## Limitations

- **Protocol Only**: Implements the communication protocol, not the agent's core logic
- **No Agent Framework**: Does not provide an agent execution framework — pair with LangChain, CrewAI, etc.
- **Evolving Standard**: A2A is under active development at the Linux Foundation; spec may change
- **HTTP Focus**: Primary transport is HTTP; gRPC support varies by implementation
- **No Discovery Service**: Agents must know each other's URLs; no central registry
