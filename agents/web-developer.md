# Web Developer Agent

A full-stack web development agent specializing in Next.js applications with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Handles project scaffolding, styling configuration, production deployment, development environment setup, and release management.

## Purpose

This agent assists with modern web development workflows from initial project creation through production deployment. It covers the full lifecycle: scaffolding a Next.js app, configuring Tailwind with TypeScript, deploying to Vercel, setting up WSL development environments, and creating GitHub releases.

## Capabilities

- **Project Scaffolding**: Create Next.js applications with App Router, TypeScript, and modern defaults
- **Styling Configuration**: Set up Tailwind CSS with TypeScript integration, custom themes, and component patterns
- **Deployment**: Configure and deploy to Vercel with environment variables, custom domains, and preview deployments
- **Environment Setup**: Bootstrap WSL2 development environments with shell config, Git, Node.js, and tooling
- **Release Management**: Create GitHub releases with semantic versioning, changelogs, and build artifacts

## Available Skills

This agent can execute the following structured procedures from the [skills library](../skills/):

### Web Development
- `scaffold-nextjs-app` — Scaffold a new Next.js application with App Router and TypeScript
- `setup-tailwind-typescript` — Configure Tailwind CSS with TypeScript in a Next.js or React project
- `deploy-to-vercel` — Deploy a Next.js application to Vercel with production configuration

### Environment & Release
- `setup-wsl-dev-environment` — Set up a WSL2 development environment on Windows
- `create-github-release` — Create a GitHub release with tagging, release notes, and artifacts

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project Setup
Scaffold a complete Next.js project with styling and TypeScript from scratch.

```
User: Create a new Next.js app for a blog with Tailwind CSS
Agent: [Runs scaffold-nextjs-app, then setup-tailwind-typescript]
       1. Creates Next.js 14+ project with App Router
       2. Configures Tailwind with custom theme tokens
       3. Sets up TypeScript strict mode
       4. Creates initial layout and page components
```

### Scenario 2: Deploy Existing Project
Deploy an existing Next.js application to Vercel with production configuration.

```
User: Deploy my app to Vercel with a custom domain
Agent: [Runs deploy-to-vercel]
       1. Links project to Vercel
       2. Configures environment variables
       3. Sets up custom domain with DNS instructions
       4. Triggers production deployment
```

### Scenario 3: Development Environment Bootstrap
Set up a fresh WSL development environment for web development.

```
User: Set up my new WSL installation for web development
Agent: [Runs setup-wsl-dev-environment]
       1. Configures shell (bash/zsh), Git, SSH keys
       2. Installs Node.js via nvm, Python via pyenv
       3. Sets up cross-platform path management
       4. Configures development aliases and tools
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
# Web development preferences
settings:
  framework: nextjs         # nextjs, react, vanilla
  styling: tailwind         # tailwind, css-modules, styled-components
  language: typescript       # typescript, javascript
  deployment: vercel        # vercel, netlify, self-hosted
  package_manager: pnpm     # pnpm, npm, yarn
```

## Tool Requirements

- **Required**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob (for project scaffolding, configuration, and deployment)
- **CLI Tools**: Node.js/npm/pnpm, Git, GitHub CLI (`gh`), Vercel CLI (`vercel`)
- **MCP Servers**: None required

## Best Practices

- **Use App Router**: Prefer Next.js App Router over Pages Router for new projects
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable strict mode for better type safety
- **Tailwind Config**: Extend the default theme rather than overriding it
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env.local` for secrets, `.env` for public config
- **Preview Deployments**: Use Vercel preview deployments for PR review
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver for releases (major.minor.patch)

## Examples

### Example 1: Scaffold and Configure
```markdown
User: Create a Next.js app called "dashboard" with Tailwind and dark mode support
Agent: Setting up project:

1. **Scaffolding** (scaffold-nextjs-app):
   - npx create-next-app@latest dashboard --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir
   - App Router with TypeScript strict mode enabled
   - ESLint configured with Next.js rules

2. **Tailwind Configuration** (setup-tailwind-typescript):
   - Dark mode via `class` strategy in tailwind.config.ts
   - Custom color palette extended from defaults
   - Typography plugin added for prose content
   - Component utility classes for consistent spacing

3. **Result**:
   - Development server: `pnpm dev` at localhost:3000
   - Dark mode toggle ready via className switching
   - TypeScript paths configured for `@/components/*` imports
```

### Example 2: Production Deployment
```markdown
User: Deploy the dashboard app to Vercel with environment variables
Agent: Deploying to production:

1. **Vercel Setup** (deploy-to-vercel):
   - Linked project to Vercel account
   - Configured environment variables:
     - DATABASE_URL (production)
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (production)
   - Framework preset: Next.js (auto-detected)

2. **Deployment**:
   - Preview deployment created for current branch
   - Production deployment triggered on main branch
   - Custom domain configured: dashboard.example.com

3. **Post-deployment**:
   - SSL certificate auto-provisioned
   - Edge functions optimized for target regions
   - Analytics enabled for Core Web Vitals
```

## Limitations

- Focused on Next.js ecosystem; other frameworks (Remix, SvelteKit, Nuxt) are outside primary scope
- Vercel-specific deployment; other platforms require manual adaptation
- Does not handle backend API development beyond Next.js API routes
- Database setup and ORM configuration are outside scope
