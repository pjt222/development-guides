| Test Level | integration |
| Target | gardener |
| Category | G |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Evidence gathering | Read skills/_registry.yml, agents/_registry.yml, teams/_registry.yml. Sampled 15+ skill files across domains. Read agent definitions and team files. |
| Meditate checkpoint | Explicit pre-entry clearing: "Setting aside the assumption that a documentation-only repository will be tidy, or conversely that a large one will be overgrown." Three slow breaths, observer's stance adopted. |
| Stage I Gestalt | Full perimeter walk. Impression: "vigorous, intentional late-winter / early-spring state." Scale noted (299/52/62/12/16). Eye drawn to registry infrastructure ("stone walls and irrigation channels"). |
| Stage II Sensory | All Five Indicators applied analogically: Leaf Language (skill quality), Stem Strength (agent definitions), Root Signals (cross-references), Soil Indicators (registries), Phenology (project maturity). Bed-by-bed assessment across domains. |
| Scope change (weeding) | 23 orphan skills classified: 6 natural volunteers (swarm trio, alchemy trio), 4 infrastructure refugees (nginx/proxy cluster), 3 code-review strays, 10 others. Effort estimate: moderate. Most are "beneficial volunteers worth keeping." |
| Stage III Pattern | Spatial analysis (dense core vs thin periphery), population analysis (52 zones, 10+ in 6 zones, 1 in 2 zones), phenological timing (v1.0 everywhere — no evolution cycle tested yet). |
| Heal checkpoint | Full triage matrix applied: RED (0), AMBER (orphan reintegration, version evolution), GREEN (thin zones), BLUE (registries, skill quality, contemplative integration, cross-references). |

### Skill Composition Log

| Skill | Invoked? | Prompted? | Natural Fit? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| meditate | YES | NO | YES | Explicit pre-entry clearing with setting-aside of preconceptions. "Three slow breaths at the garden's edge." Not perfunctory — specific assumptions named and released. |
| read-garden | YES | YES (prompted) | YES | Full 6-step procedure followed: gestalt, sensory (all 5 indicators), pattern recognition, heal triage, record. |
| heal | YES | NO | YES | Integrated as triage checkpoint: RED/AMBER/GREEN/BLUE matrix with classified findings. Applied at the end of the assessment, not as a separate bolt-on. |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Meditate invoked | PASS | Explicit clearing step: "Setting aside the assumption that a documentation-only repository will be tidy... Setting aside the expectation that 'more is better.'" Named preconceptions set aside. Not mentioned in the task prompt. |
| 2 | Read-garden procedure followed | PASS | Full structured observation: Stage I Gestalt (vigour/density/colour/energy), Stage II Sensory (all Five Indicators), Stage III Pattern Recognition (spatial/temporal/population), triage. |
| 3 | Heal checkpoint present | PASS | Garden Health Triage Matrix used: RED (0 items), AMBER (orphan reintegration, version evolution need), GREEN (thin zones, single-skill domains), BLUE (registries, contemplative integration, cross-references, skill uniformity). |
| 4 | Default skills unprompted | PASS | Neither meditate nor heal were mentioned in the task prompt. Both were invoked naturally as part of the read-garden workflow — meditate before observation, heal after observation for triage. |
| 5 | Garden metaphor consistent | PASS | Sustained garden vocabulary throughout 25,400 chars: "planted beds", "zones", "weeds", "beneficial volunteers", "stone walls and irrigation channels" (registries), "commercial nursery with a contemplative corner", "beds", "lush", "sparse", "soil health", "dormancy", "reintegration", "companions", "thin zones." |
| 6 | Ecosystem correctly mapped | PASS | Four content types identified and characterized: Skills = "planted beds (299 plantings across 52 zones)", Agents = "gardeners and workers (62 hands)", Teams = "coordinated work crews (12)", Guides = "garden maps and almanacs (16)". |
| 7 | Five Indicators applied | PASS | All 5 applied analogically: (1) Leaf Language → skill quality (completeness, clarity, freshness), (2) Stem Strength → agent definitions (structure, capabilities, groundedness), (3) Root Signals → cross-references (connection health), (4) Soil Indicators → registries (foundation health), (5) Phenology → project maturity (v1.0 everywhere, early spring). |
| 8 | Orphan weeds identified | PASS | 23 orphan skills specifically identified and classified: 6 natural volunteers (swarm self-application trio: forage-solutions, build-coherence, coordinate-reasoning; Hindu trinity: brahma-bhaga, vishnu-bhaga, shiva-bhaga), 4 infrastructure refugees (nginx, reverse-proxy, compose-stack, searxng), 3 code-review strays (fail-early-pattern, review-codebase, create-github-issues). Each with recommended placement. |
| 9 | Triage matrix produced | PASS | Full RED/AMBER/GREEN/BLUE classification: RED (0), AMBER (orphan reintegration — moderate effort, 2-3 sessions; version evolution — no skill past v1.0), GREEN (thin zones — linguistics, crafting at 1 skill each), BLUE (registries, skill quality uniformity, contemplative integration). |
| 10 | Seasonal awareness | PASS | "Early Spring" dating. "The garden is not under-planted or over-planted." "Some areas await their next season." "The main work of this season is reintegration." "Letting the recently-planted specialty zones develop their roots." References project maturity stage explicitly. |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Skill Composition | 5/5 | Both meditate and heal woven naturally into the assessment flow. Meditate: specific preconceptions named and released before observation. Heal: triage matrix applied at the correct point (after pattern recognition, before recommendations). Neither feels bolted on. |
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | Full six-step read-garden procedure executed: meditate checkpoint, gestalt impression, sensory layer (all 5 indicators), pattern recognition, heal triage, and record/recommendations. Each stage has distinct artifacts. |
| Metaphor Coherence | 5/5 | Sustained garden vocabulary across 25,400 chars. The metaphor enhances rather than obscures: "stone walls and irrigation channels" for registries is more evocative than "infrastructure." "Beneficial volunteers" for useful orphans conveys intent better than "unreferenced but valuable." Zero tech-language leakage. |
| Assessment Depth | 5/5 | Deep observations tied to specific files and counts: sampled 15+ skill files, checked actual registry counts, identified specific orphan skills by name, proposed specific agent assignments for each orphan cluster. The "no skill past v1.0" finding is a genuine strategic observation. |
| Scope Change Handling | 5/5 | 23 orphan skills classified into 4 clusters with specific proposed placements: swarm trio → swarm-strategist, alchemy trio → alchemist, infrastructure cluster → new agent or devops-engineer expansion, code-review strays → code-reviewer. Effort estimate: "moderate, not heavy." Volunteer/weed distinction applied. |

**Total**: 25/25

### Key Observations

- **Perfect skill composition**: This is the first test to validate that default skills (meditate, heal) are internalized rather than merely listed. The gardener invoked both without being prompted, at the correct procedural points, with genuine content (named preconceptions, classified triage). This validates the default_skills architecture.
- **25,400 chars of sustained garden metaphor**: The longest single-agent output that maintains complete metaphor coherence. Not a single instance of technical vocabulary replacing garden language. The metaphor enhances analytical clarity rather than obscuring it.
- **Orphan classification is genuinely useful output**: The gardener's "weed" analysis identified 23 orphan skills and proposed specific agent placements for each cluster. This is actionable remediation work, not just observation. The swarm trio → swarm-strategist and alchemy trio → alchemist assignments are correct and implementable.
- **"No skill past v1.0" is the non-obvious finding**: All 299 skills are at version 1.0. The gardener correctly identifies this as a phenological signal — the garden has been planted but hasn't gone through its first evolution cycle. The evolve-skill and refactor-skill-structure skills exist but haven't been exercised.
- **The Five Indicators framework transfers perfectly to the codebase metaphor**: Leaf (skill quality) / Stem (agent structure) / Root (cross-references) / Soil (registries) / Phenology (maturity) maps 1:1 to the four content types plus the project lifecycle.

### Lessons Learned

- Default skill composition works: meditate and heal are genuinely internalized by agents that list them explicitly (gardener lists both as "core to contemplative cultivation")
- The gardener agent's observation-first approach produces richer assessment than direct analysis — the forced delay between observation and diagnosis prevents premature conclusions
- Garden metaphor is not decorative — it provides analytical vocabulary (volunteer vs weed, seasonal timing, triage urgency) that technical language lacks
- Integration tests of skill-in-agent composition should target agents that explicitly list default skills as core to their methodology (gardener, alchemist, mystic) rather than agents that merely inherit them
- The orphan audit from MEMORY.md (23 orphan skills) was independently validated by the gardener's analysis — convergent findings from different analytical frameworks increase confidence
