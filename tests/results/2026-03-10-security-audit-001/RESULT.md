## Run: 2026-03-10-security-audit-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 10m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-security-audit-codebase-self |
| Test Level | skill |
| Target | security-audit-codebase |
| Category | E |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Step 1 (Secrets) | Searched for sk-, ghp_, AKIA, private keys, Bearer tokens, passwords. Found only placeholder examples in skill docs. Zero real secrets. |
| Step 2 (Gitignore) | Found .gitignore missing .env, .Renviron, .RData, .Rhistory. Classified as MEDIUM preventive gap. |
| Step 3 (Dependencies) | npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities. viz/package.json: 7 deps (d3, marked, DOMPurify etc). DOMPurify upgraded to 3.3.2 for CVE fix. |
| Step 4 (Injection) | Found innerHTML usage in viz/ code, mitigated with escHtml helper. execSync in build-workflow.js uses hardcoded command (safe). |
| Scope change | Git history scan: no deleted .env/.key/.pem files, no sk-/ghp_/AKIA patterns in history beyond placeholders |
| Step 5 (Auth) | N/A with detailed rationale: no login flows, no password storage, no API endpoints, no session management |
| Step 6 (Config) | CI permissions reviewed: all 5 workflows use least-privilege. SHA-pinned third-party actions. |
| Step 7 (Report) | Structured report: 6 findings (1 MEDIUM, 5 LOW), CI permissions table, git history scan results, overall CONDITIONAL PASS |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Secrets scan executed | PASS | Grep patterns for sk-, ghp_, AKIA, private keys, Bearer, password= run across all file types. Results table with zero real secrets. |
| 2 | No false positives on placeholders | PASS | All placeholder patterns (YOUR_TOKEN_HERE, sup3rs3cr3t!, sk-1234567890abcdef) correctly classified as "illustrative placeholder values" and "not a finding." |
| 3 | Gitignore verified | PASS | Checked .gitignore for .env, .Renviron, .RData, .Rhistory, credentials.json, *.pem, *.key. Found gaps and classified as MEDIUM finding with specific remediation. |
| 4 | Dependency audit performed | PASS | npm audit on both root and viz/ package.json. Zero vulnerabilities. Noted DOMPurify 3.3.2 upgrade for XSS CVE. |
| 5 | Injection scan completed or N/A'd | PASS | Found innerHTML in viz/ code, noted mitigation with escHtml. Found execSync with static command (safe). Classified as "mitigated" rather than N/A — applied check to the JavaScript that exists. |
| 6 | Auth marked N/A with rationale | PASS | Detailed N/A rationale listing 5 absent auth patterns (login, passwords, sessions, API auth, CSRF/CORS). Noted GITHUB_TOKEN uses built-in secret management. |
| 7 | Report produced | PASS | Complete structured report with: Findings table (6 items with severity), CI permissions matrix, git history scan table, recommendations (3 items), validation checklist, overall verdict. |
| 8 | Overall verdict is PASS | PASS | "CONDITIONAL PASS" — clean except for .gitignore gaps. Appropriate since the gap is preventive (no tracked sensitive files) but real (safety net missing). |
| 9 | Git history check performed | PASS | Scope change absorbed: searched git history for deleted .env/.key/.pem files and sk-/ghp_/AKIA patterns. All clean. |
| 10 | Report matches SKILL.md template | PASS | Report follows the security-audit-codebase Step 7 template structure: findings with severity, CI review, recommendations, validation checklist, verdict. |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 7 steps executed in order with clear delineation. Each step produced specific commands/patterns searched and findings. Steps 5 (Auth) correctly handled as N/A with rationale. |
| Accuracy | 5/5 | Zero false positives. Placeholders correctly classified. .gitignore gap is a genuine finding. innerHTML mitigation correctly noted. CONDITIONAL PASS is the right verdict (not inflated to FAIL, not deflated to clean PASS). |
| Report Quality | 5/5 | Complete report with all template sections: findings table, CI permissions matrix, git history scan, recommendations, validation checklist, verdict. Each finding has severity, location, description, recommendation, and status. |
| Context Sensitivity | 5/5 | Fully adapted to docs repo: Auth marked N/A, injection check focused on the JS that exists (viz/), supply chain check on CI pip install and Dockerfile curl. Did not check for SQL injection, CSRF, or other web-app patterns. |
| Scope Change Handling | 5/5 | Full git history scan performed with 4 pattern checks. Results presented in table format. Clean history confirmed. |

**Total**: 25/25

### Key Observations

- **Procedure fidelity is the standout metric**: This is a skill-level test, and the 7-step procedure was followed precisely. Each step maps to a specific section in the output with clear methodology and findings.
- **CONDITIONAL PASS is nuanced judgment**: Rather than a binary PASS/FAIL, the agent recognized that the .gitignore gap is real but preventive. "Once that is addressed, this would be a clean PASS" — this is the correct calibration.
- **Found genuine findings D2 missed**: The viz/ directory's innerHTML usage and DOMPurify mitigation, the Dockerfile curl|bash pattern, and the execSync in build-workflow.js were all caught. D2 (security-analyst agent test) focused on the docs; E7 applied the full 7-step procedure and went deeper into the code that exists.
- **Git history scan was clean**: The scope change trigger (check history for removed secrets) found nothing — confirming the codebase has never had committed secrets.
- **Skill procedure vs agent persona**: Comparing E7 (skill test) to D2 (agent test) shows the skill procedure provides more structure — all 7 categories are guaranteed to be checked. The agent test produced similar findings but with more discretionary depth.

### Lessons Learned

- The security-audit-codebase skill procedure's 7-step structure ensures comprehensive coverage — no category is skipped
- CONDITIONAL PASS with specific remediation is more useful than either PASS or FAIL for a codebase with preventive gaps
- Skill-level tests produce more structured, reproducible output than agent-level tests because the procedure constrains the execution path
- The scope change (git history scan) was cleanly absorbed into the workflow between Steps 4 and 5
