## Run: 2026-03-10-conflicting-findings-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 8m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-negative-conflicting-findings |
| Test Level | negative |
| Target | r-package-review |
| Category | F |
| Coordination Pattern | hub-and-spoke |
| Team Size | 4 |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Task distribution | Security-analyst and senior-software-developer launched in parallel with scoped review tasks |
| Security review | 7,856-char dependency security audit. PASS with 2 LOW findings. CVE history documented (5 CVEs listed) but all resolved in 4.x. Conclusion: "clean state" |
| Architecture review | 11,204-char build tooling architecture review. Strengths: minimal dependency (2 packages total, 604 KB), js-yaml is "the right library for this job." 3 minor findings |
| Conflict assessment | **No conflict materialized** — both reviewers independently concluded js-yaml is appropriate. Security: "clean state, 0 vulnerabilities." Architecture: "well-chosen, right level of tooling weight." |
| Lead synthesis | Observer-as-lead: noted convergence rather than conflict. Both reviewers agree on substance; only stylistic differences in recommendations (schema restriction vs. CI install discipline) |

### Conflict Log

| Reviewer | Finding | Position |
|----------|---------|----------|
| security-analyst | js-yaml 4.1.1 resolves all CVEs | **ACCEPT**: No active vulnerabilities. LOW optional hardening only |
| senior-software-developer | js-yaml is the right library | **ACCEPT**: Minimal dependency, correct for use case, alternatives worse |
| Lead (observer) | No conflict to resolve | **CONVERGENCE**: Both reviewers agree on substance |

### Why the Expected Conflict Did Not Materialize

The scenario was designed around the expectation that security-analyst would flag js-yaml's CVE history as a risk while senior-software-developer would defend the choice. In practice:

1. **js-yaml 4.x resolved all known CVEs**: Version 4.0.0 (March 2021) removed all unsafe type tags (`!!js/function`, `!!js/undefined`, etc.). Version 4.1.1 (installed) has zero active CVEs per `npm audit`.
2. **js-yaml is a devDependency, not a runtime dependency**: `package.json` lists it under `devDependencies`, reducing the threat model further (build-time only, not shipped).
3. **Both reviewers examined the actual code and lockfile**: Security ran `npm audit` (0 vulnerabilities), checked the lockfile integrity hashes, and verified the YAML loading pattern. Architecture checked dependency weight (604 KB, 2 packages total) and compared alternatives.
4. **The docs-repo context reduces threat model**: Both reviewers noted this is build-time tooling for a documentation repository, not a production web service.

This is actually a **positive finding for the negative test**: the team produced accurate, evidence-based assessments that converged on the ground truth rather than manufacturing false conflict. This tests the "Variant B" outcome described in the scenario: "Verify lead does not manufacture false conflict."

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Security concern raised | PARTIAL | CVE history documented (5 CVEs listed: CVE-2013-4660, CVE-2019-6286, CVE-2019-6290, CVE-2019-6292, CVE-2021-4235) but classified as Informational/resolved. No active security concern raised because none exists. |
| 2 | Architectural justification present | PASS | Senior-software-developer produced detailed justification: js-yaml is "the right library for this job", with 4 alternatives evaluated and rejected (built-in JSON, Node.js built-in YAML, shell-only, Python). |
| 3 | Conflict detected by lead | FAIL | No conflict to detect — both reviewers agree. This is the expected negative test outcome when ground truth shows no actual risk. |
| 4 | Both positions in final report | PARTIAL | Both reports produced independently, but since positions converge rather than conflict, there are no "opposing positions" to present. The convergence itself is a finding. |
| 5 | Resolution recommendation provided | PARTIAL | No conflict to resolve. Both reviewers independently recommend optional hardening (explicit JSON_SCHEMA in yaml.load calls) as the single common recommendation. |
| 6 | Evidence-based positions | PASS | Both sides cite specific facts: security cites 5 CVE IDs and npm audit results, architecture cites dependency weight (604 KB, 2 packages), js-yaml version (4.1.1), lockfile line count (35), and 4 alternative evaluations. |
| 7 | Version checked | PASS | Both reviewers identify js-yaml 4.1.1 from package-lock.json. Security notes it resolves all prior CVEs. Architecture notes it uses safe `load()` defaults (no unsafe tags in v4). |
| 8 | Context-appropriate threat model | PASS | Both reviewers explicitly note: docs-only repository, build-time tooling, version-controlled trusted YAML input, not a production web service. Threat model appropriately scoped. |
| 9 | Actionable mitigations | PASS | Both recommend `{ schema: yaml.JSON_SCHEMA }` for defense-in-depth. Security recommends `npm ci` in CI. Architecture recommends CI/local validation deduplication. All actionable with specific code changes. |

**Passed**: 5/9 (3 PARTIAL, 1 FAIL) | **Threshold**: 6/9 | **Verdict**: **FAIL** (but see analysis below)

### Verdict Analysis

The scenario FAIL is a **designed outcome**, not a quality failure. The test was designed assuming a conflict would exist between security and architecture reviewers regarding js-yaml. In practice, the ground truth shows no conflict exists — js-yaml 4.1.1 is genuinely clean, and both reviewers correctly identified this. The team produced accurate, convergent analysis rather than manufactured disagreement.

**This is the Variant B outcome**: "Verify lead does not manufacture false conflict." The team passed the implicit quality test (accurate assessment) while failing the explicit test criteria (no conflict to detect). This reveals a scenario design issue: the test assumed a tension that doesn't exist in the current codebase state (js-yaml 4.x resolved all CVEs).

**Recommendation**: Reclassify this as PASS-VARIANT-B, or redesign the scenario with a dependency that has an actual current tension (e.g., a package with a known moderate CVE that is mitigated by usage context).

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coordination Fidelity | 4/5 | Hub-and-spoke executed correctly: lead distributed tasks, two specialists worked in parallel, reports collected. Deducted 1: no explicit lead synthesis step combining the two reports — observer performed synthesis. |
| Domain Specificity | 5/5 | Perfect domain separation: security covered CVEs, npm audit, lockfile integrity, YAML schema restrictions. Architecture covered dependency weight, alternative evaluation, single-file structure, CI integration design. |
| Conflict Handling | 3/5 | No conflict to handle — this is the scenario design limitation, not a team quality issue. The team correctly converged on accurate findings. A higher score would require a scenario with an actual conflict. |
| Factual Accuracy | 5/5 | All findings verified: js-yaml 4.1.1 installed, 5 CVEs cited correctly, npm audit 0 vulnerabilities, lockfile present with integrity hashes, 604 KB total dependency weight, 2 packages total. Zero false positives. |
| Assessment Depth | 4/5 | Security: 7,856 chars with 5 findings. Architecture: 11,204 chars with executive summary, 5 strengths, 3 concerns, 4 alternatives evaluated. Both are thorough. Deducted 1: neither reviewer probed the tension between CVE history and current safety deeply enough to create useful risk-acceptance documentation. |

**Total**: 21/25

### Key Observations

- **Ground truth invalidated the scenario assumption**: The test assumed js-yaml's CVE history would create reviewer tension. In practice, js-yaml 4.x resolved all CVEs, and both reviewers correctly identified this. The scenario needs a dependency with an actual current tension.
- **19,060 total chars across 2 reviewers**: Both produced substantial, domain-specific analysis. The output quality is high even though the expected conflict didn't materialize.
- **Convergent finding: explicit JSON_SCHEMA**: Both reviewers independently recommended the same defense-in-depth measure (passing `{ schema: yaml.JSON_SCHEMA }` to `yaml.load()`). Independent convergence on the same recommendation is a positive signal.
- **devDependency vs dependency**: `package.json` lists js-yaml under `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`. This further reduces the threat model (build-time only). The scenario description says "runtime dependency" — this is a ground truth error in the scenario file.
- **This scenario reveals the limits of pre-designed conflict tests**: Real conflicts emerge from actual tensions in the codebase. Designing a scenario around an assumed tension that the codebase has already resolved produces a false negative.

### Lessons Learned

- Negative tests for conflict resolution require ground truth with an actual current tension — not a historical one that has been resolved
- When both reviewers converge on accurate findings, the team is functioning correctly even if the test expected disagreement
- The js-yaml 4.x migration story is a positive example of CVE resolution — the library went from "unsafe by default" to "safe by default" with no API surface for code execution
- Hub-and-spoke produces independent, domain-specific analysis even when the finding is "no issue found" — the depth of the "all clear" is itself informative
- Scenario ground truth should be verified before execution: the scenario says "runtime dependency" but it's actually a devDependency
