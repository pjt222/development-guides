**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 8m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-devops-engineer-ci-review |
| Test Level | agent |
| Target | devops-engineer |
| Category | D |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| File discovery | Agent read all 5 workflow files in `.github/workflows/` individually before analysis |
| Per-workflow review | Each workflow analyzed across all 6 assessment dimensions: action pinning, permissions, caching, matrix, failure handling, secrets |
| Cross-cutting findings | Common patterns identified: `@v6` tag usage across all workflows, missing `timeout-minutes` universally, inconsistent permissions placement |
| Scope change | Consolidation assessment produced with detailed per-workflow tradeoff analysis |
| Delivery | 15,952-char CI Review Report with per-workflow findings, prioritized recommendations with YAML snippets |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All 5 workflows reviewed | PASS | Each of the 5 workflows (deploy-pages, validate-skills, update-readmes, validate-tests, validate-integrity) has a dedicated section with all 6 dimensions assessed. No workflow skipped. |
| 2 | DevOps persona maintained | PASS | CI/CD-specific vocabulary throughout: OIDC keyless authentication, floating version tags, caching keys, concurrency groups, `cancel-in-progress`, reusable workflows, composite actions, action provenance, `skills-ref` SHA pinning, `npm ci` vs `npm install`. |
| 3 | Action pinning assessed | PASS | Every workflow's action versions checked. Key finding: all use `@v6` floating tags for first-party actions, while `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action` is correctly SHA-pinned to `04702edda442b2e678b25b537cec683a1493fcb9`. Agent notes `@v6` for checkout may not exist (latest stable is v4). |
| 4 | Permissions evaluated | PASS | Each workflow's `permissions:` block assessed: deploy-pages (correct: contents:read, pages:write, id-token:write), validate-skills (correct: contents:read), update-readmes (correct but job-level instead of workflow-level), validate-tests (correct: contents:read), validate-integrity (correct: contents:read). |
| 5 | Specific YAML provided | PASS | 6 concrete YAML snippets: (1) `timeout-minutes: 10` for all jobs, (2) `persist-credentials: false` on checkout, (3) `cache: 'npm'` for validate-integrity, (4) pip cache configuration for validate-skills, (5) workflow-level permissions for update-readmes, (6) `npm ci` in CI. |
| 6 | Severity ratings applied | PASS | Findings prioritized: Priority 1 HIGH (SHA-pin all actions), Priority 2 MEDIUM (add timeout-minutes), Priority 3 MEDIUM (persist-credentials:false), Priority 4 LOW (cache pip for validate-skills), Priority 5 LOW (normalize permissions placement), Priority 6 HIGH (verify @v6 tags). |
| 7 | Per-workflow structure | PASS | Report organized with 5 dedicated sections (one per workflow), each containing all 6 assessment dimensions. Not a generic summary — each workflow's unique characteristics are noted. |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | PASS | Consolidation assessment with per-workflow pair analysis. Recommendation: keep 5 workflows (permission boundaries), add 1 composite action for shared validation shell pattern. Tradeoff analysis: validate-tests could merge with validate-integrity but path-filter complexity outweighs benefit. update-readmes must stay separate (contents:write). deploy-pages must stay separate (pages:write). |
| 9 | Caching opportunities identified | PASS | npm caching already present in deploy-pages (correct). Missing in validate-integrity (could add npm cache) and validate-skills (could add pip cache keyed on skills-ref SHA). Specific YAML provided for both. |
| 10 | Failure handling reviewed | PASS | Noted: no `timeout-minutes` on any of the 5 workflows. `concurrency` correctly configured on deploy-pages with `cancel-in-progress: false`. The `failed=0` / `exit $failed` pattern in validation workflows is praised as correct (checks all files before failing). |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Skill Fidelity | 5/5 | Systematic review of all 6 assessment dimensions per workflow. No dimension skipped for any workflow. The consolidation assessment demonstrates reusable workflow knowledge. |
| Persona Consistency | 5/5 | Deep infrastructure engineer voice: OIDC, `cancel-in-progress`, `persist-credentials`, `npm ci`, composite actions vs reusable workflows, action provenance chain. Zero generic code review language. |
| Technical Depth | 5/5 | Expert-level: identified `@v6` tag anomaly (v4 is latest stable), noted OIDC keyless auth as correct pattern, distinguished first-party vs third-party action pinning strategy, identified the `skills-ref` SHA pin as a deliberate contrast to floating action tags. |
| Domain Expertise | 5/5 | Deep Actions knowledge: understands permission boundaries (why deploy-pages needs id-token:write), concurrency group semantics, why `cancel-in-progress: false` is correct for deployments, the distinction between reusable workflows and composite actions. |
| Recommendation Quality | 4/5 | Concrete YAML diffs with rationale for each change. Consolidation assessment is detailed with clear tradeoffs. Deducted 1: could have provided exact SHA pins for actions/checkout@v4 and actions/setup-node@v4 rather than leaving as an exercise. |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **`@v6` tag anomaly is the standout finding**: The devops-engineer correctly identified that `@v6` for `actions/checkout` may not exist (latest stable is v4), elevating a routine version-pinning recommendation to a potential correctness issue. This is a finding that requires actual verification against the upstream repo.
- **Permission boundary reasoning drives the consolidation recommendation**: The agent's recommendation to keep 5 separate workflows is driven by the observation that merging would require elevating permissions (e.g., giving validation workflows `contents: write`). This is security-aware architecture reasoning, not just preference.
- **15,952 chars of pure CI/CD analysis**: Comparable to the C1 team-level devops-engineer output (13,846 chars) but produced solo. The agent-level test produces similar depth to the team-level test for its specific domain.
- **`skills-ref` SHA pin recognized as deliberate contrast**: The agent noted that `validate-skills.yml` pins `skills-ref` to a commit SHA while using floating `@v6` for GitHub Actions — calling out the inconsistency in pinning philosophy.

### Lessons Learned

- The devops-engineer agent produces expert-level CI/CD analysis when given a real workflow set — the self-referential target provides verifiable ground truth
- Per-workflow structure produces more actionable output than a generic cross-workflow summary — each workflow has unique characteristics
- The consolidation assessment is the most architecturally interesting output: it tests whether the agent understands when NOT to consolidate (permission boundaries, trigger path specificity)
- Agent-level tests of domain specialists (devops-engineer on CI/CD) approach team-level depth because the task is within the agent's core competency
