**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 8m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-security-analyst-repo-scan |
| Test Level | agent |
| Target | security-analyst |
| Category | D |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Secret scan | Agent searched for sk-, ghp_, AKIA, private keys, Bearer tokens, hf_ tokens, password= patterns across all file types |
| CI review | Reviewed all 5 GitHub Actions workflows for permissions, expression injection, action pinning, concurrency |
| Script analysis | Read scripts/generate-readmes.js (no exec/eval/shell/network) and scripts/validate-integrity.sh (set -euo pipefail, safe patterns) |
| Dependency audit | Checked package.json (1 dep: js-yaml), ran npm audit (0 vulnerabilities), verified package-lock.json |
| Gitignore check | Found .Renviron, .RData, .Rhistory, .env not covered — noted as LOW since no R files exist here |
| Information disclosure | Searched for C:\Users\*, /home/<username>/, personal paths — all clean, guides use placeholders |
| Report delivery | Structured audit report with 5 findings (1 LOW, 4 INFO), overall verdict PASS |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Systematic scan performed | PASS | Searched for sk-, ghp_, AKIA, private keys, Bearer, hf_ tokens, password= across markdown, YAML, JSON, JS, shell. Pattern-based scan, not ad-hoc browsing. |
| 2 | Security persona maintained | PASS | Consistent security vocabulary: "threat model", "attack surface", "risk rating", "supply-chain best practice", "expression injection", "collision-resistant". Report uses security audit format throughout. |
| 3 | No false positives on placeholders | PASS | Explicitly confirmed placeholders as clean: "Confirmed as illustrative placeholder in code blocks — not a real credential. No action needed." YOUR_API_KEY patterns noted as "Confirmed as placeholders. Clean." |
| 4 | CI permissions reviewed | PASS | Detailed review: least-privilege confirmed, read-only for validation workflows, contents:write only for update-readmes.yml, pages:write only for deploy-pages.yml. Expression injection analysis: only one ${{ }} in non-run context. Concurrency settings checked. |
| 5 | Scripts analyzed | PASS | generate-readmes.js: "No exec(), no eval(), no shell spawning, no network calls, no user input handling beyond --check flag. CLEAN." validate-integrity.sh: "Uses set -euo pipefail. All file paths derived from controlled find/basename operations." |
| 6 | Clean status confirmed | PASS | "Overall Verdict: PASS" with category ratings table: Secrets CLEAN, Gitignore LOW RISK, Dependencies CLEAN, CI/CD CLEAN, Scripts CLEAN. |
| 7 | Risk ratings used | PASS | Five findings rated: F1=LOW, F2=INFO, F3=INFO, F4=INFO, F5=INFO. No inflation — the only non-INFO finding is a genuine .gitignore gap. |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | BLOCKED | Scope change trigger (threat model assessment) was not injected during autonomous background execution. Agent naturally addressed scope calibration ("docs-only repo") but no dedicated threat model section. |
| 9 | Dependency check performed | PASS | Checked package.json (1 dependency, private package), ran npm audit (0 vulnerabilities), verified package-lock.json present and audited. |
| 10 | Evidence cited | PASS | Every finding references specific files and patterns: ".github/workflows/validate-skills.yml:26" for partial SHA, "skills/deploy-to-kubernetes/SKILL.md:158" for example password, specific grep patterns for each secret type. |

**Passed**: 9/10 (1 BLOCKED) | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Skill Fidelity | 5/5 | Full systematic methodology covering all scan categories: secrets, CI/CD, scripts, dependencies, information disclosure, gitignore. Structured like the security-audit-codebase skill procedure. |
| Persona Consistency | 5/5 | Consistent security analyst voice throughout. Uses "expression injection", "supply-chain best practice", "collision-resistant", "least-privilege", "attack surface". No breaks into casual language. |
| False Positive Rate | 5/5 | Zero false positives. Placeholder examples correctly classified as "illustrative" and "clean." The only non-INFO finding (F1 missing .gitignore entries) is a genuine gap, correctly rated LOW since no R files exist in this repo. |
| Scope Calibration | 5/5 | Perfectly calibrated to docs repo threat surface. Focused on CI permissions, script safety, and configuration — the areas with real risk. Did not check for SQL injection, XSS, or other web-app vulnerabilities. Noted "this is a docs-only repo" multiple times when contextualizing findings. |
| Analytical Rigor | 5/5 | Every conclusion backed by specific files, patterns, and line numbers. Script analysis details exact unsafe patterns checked (exec, eval, shell spawning). CI review covers permissions, expression injection points, action pinning strategy, and concurrency. |

**Total**: 25/25

### Key Observations

- **Zero false positives on a clean repo is the core success**: The agent confirmed clean status without manufacturing findings or inflating severity. This is exactly what the scenario was designed to test.
- **Genuine LOW finding discovered**: The .gitignore gap for R-specific files (.Renviron, .RData, .Rhistory) is a real finding that the previous manual audit also noted. The agent correctly rated it LOW since no R files exist in the repository.
- **CI supply chain nuance**: Agent distinguished between official GitHub actions (floating tags acceptable) and third-party actions (SHA pinning required), noting that stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action is correctly SHA-pinned. This shows calibrated judgment, not blanket recommendations.
- **Partial SHA observation**: Identified the 12-character partial commit SHA in validate-skills.yml pip install as a best-practice gap (full 40-char SHA preferred). Correctly rated INFO, not a vulnerability.
- **Scope change not tested**: The threat model assessment trigger was not injected since the agent ran autonomously in background. Future runs should inject the scope change mid-execution.

### Lessons Learned

- General-purpose agents (without subagent_type) perform security audits effectively when given explicit instructions — they avoid the context consumption of auto-loaded skill definitions
- A clean codebase is the hardest test for a security analyst — the temptation to inflate findings is real. This agent passed cleanly.
- Background agent execution precludes scope change injection — future autonomous runs need a mechanism to inject scope changes mid-flight
