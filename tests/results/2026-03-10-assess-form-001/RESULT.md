### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-assess-form-skill-review |
| Test Level | skill |
| Target | assess-form |
| Category | E |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Step 1 (Inventory) | Mapped 7 structural components. 217 lines (43.4% of 500 limit). 7 steps, 26 sub-steps, 7 Expected blocks, 7 On failure blocks, 10 validation items. Skeleton (2): procedure sequence, tool permissions. Flesh (5): prose sections, checklist, sub-steps. |
| Step 2 (Pressure) | External: scenario library growth (6→30), test level proliferation (5 levels, skill is team-centric). Internal: name-scope mismatch ("test-team-coordination" but used for all levels), Step 4 under-specified for non-team tests. |
| Step 3 (Rigidity) | Score: 8/18 (FLEXIBLE). Low coupling, low data entanglement, low deployment friction. Moderate: Step 4 is a "god step" (7 sub-steps), limited test coverage of the skill itself. |
| Step 4 (Capacity) | HIGH capacity. Minor revision (rename + branching) = 1 session. Moderate revision (decompose Step 4) = 2-3 sessions. Author has 299-skill creation experience and morphic evolution tooling. |
| Step 5 (Classify) | **READY** — transform now with minimal risk. High pressure / low rigidity / high capacity quadrant. |
| Scope change | Compared to review-skill-format (OPTIONAL, v1.1, healthiest) and review-codebase (OPTIONAL, leanest, most ambitious). test-team-coordination is the only one needing transformation. |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All 5 steps executed | PASS | Inventory, Pressure Mapping, Rigidity Assessment, Change Capacity, Readiness Classification — all 5 present with specific metrics and analysis. |
| 2 | Structural inventory quantified | PASS | Precise metrics: 217 lines, 7 steps, 26 sub-steps, 7 Expected/On failure blocks, 10 validation items, 5 pitfalls, 6 related skills. Skeleton/flesh classification for each component. |
| 3 | Pressure mapping identifies real pressures | PASS | 4 external pressures (scenario growth HIGH, level proliferation MEDIUM, pattern coverage MEDIUM, aggregation needs LOW) and 3 internal pressures (name-scope mismatch HIGH, Step 4 specificity MEDIUM, timestamp guidance LOW). Plus 3 resistance forces. |
| 4 | Rigidity assessment uses metrics | PASS | 6-dimension scoring table (interface coupling, god module count, data entanglement, deployment friction, test coverage gaps, "don't touch" zones). Total 8/18 = FLEXIBLE. |
| 5 | Change capacity estimated | PASS | Three-tier effort estimate: minor (1 session), moderate (2-3 sessions), major (not needed). Assessed team capacity, absorption rate, transformation experience, risk tolerance. |
| 6 | Readiness classification produced | PASS | **READY** classification with quadrant placement (high pressure / low rigidity / high capacity) and 5 specific recommended next steps with risk factors. |
| 7 | Cross-domain application works | PASS | The morphic assessment framework (designed for software systems) produced coherent analysis of a skill file. Structural inventory, pressure mapping, and rigidity scoring all transferred meaningfully to the SKILL.md format. |
| 8 | Scope change: comparison produced | PASS | Three-way comparison table: test-team-coordination (READY, 217 lines, 7 steps) vs review-skill-format (OPTIONAL, 197 lines, 6 steps) vs review-codebase (OPTIONAL, 165 lines, 6 steps). Per-metric comparison with health assessment per skill. |

**Passed**: 8/8 | **Threshold**: 6/8 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 5 assess-form steps executed with morphic terminology (skeleton/flesh, geological layers, pressure balance, god module). Each step has quantified metrics. |
| Cross-Domain Value | 5/5 | The morphic framework transfers to SKILL.md assessment without forcing. Structural inventory maps to sections/frontmatter, pressure mapping identifies real evolution needs, rigidity scoring reveals Step 4 as the key intervention point. |
| Analytical Depth | 5/5 | Goes beyond surface: "The skill was born whole in one pass — no iterative accretion" (geological layers), "name constrains perception of scope" (internal pressure), "acknowledgment is not remediation" (resistance analysis). |
| Actionability | 5/5 | 5 specific recommended next steps with effort estimates: (1) rename to execute-test-scenario, (2) add test-level branching to Step 3, (3) add branching to Step 4, (4) add per-level timestamp schemes, (5) version to 2.0. Risk factors identified (cascade through registry, symlinks, cross-refs). |
| Comparative Rigor | 4/5 | Three-way structural metrics table with 13 dimensions. Health assessment per skill with specific evidence. Could have included more quantitative comparison (e.g., sub-step density, tool-count-to-complexity ratio). |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **Name-scope mismatch is the most impactful finding**: The skill is named "test-team-coordination" but serves as the general test execution framework for all 5 test levels. This was also independently identified by the meditate skill's bias audit (the framework expanded beyond its named scope).
- **READY classification with specific effort estimates is actionable**: Unlike vague "needs improvement" advice, the 3-tier effort estimate (1 session for rename+branch, 2-3 for decompose, not needed for rewrite) gives concrete planning data.
- **God-step identification (Step 4)**: The assess-form procedure correctly identified Step 4 (Execute the Task) as the structural concentration point — 7 sub-steps, team-specific tools, the longest section. This is where non-team test levels need the most adaptation.
- **Cross-skill comparison validates the framework**: review-skill-format (OPTIONAL, healthy) and review-codebase (OPTIONAL, lean) serve as control subjects. Only test-team-coordination needs transformation, confirming the diagnosis is specific, not generic.
- **Convergent findings across tests**: The name-scope mismatch was identified by assess-form (structural analysis), meditate (meta-cognitive analysis), and advocatus-diaboli (logical critique). Three independent approaches converging on the same finding increases confidence.

### Lessons Learned

- The assess-form skill's morphic framework (inventory, pressure, rigidity, capacity, classification) transfers well to non-software targets — a SKILL.md file has enough structure to assess
- Readiness classifications (READY/PREPARE/INVEST/CRITICAL/OPTIONAL/DEFER) are more useful than pass/fail for evolution decisions
- Cross-skill comparison within a domain (3 review-domain skills) provides calibration for the assessment — without comparators, a single assessment lacks scale
