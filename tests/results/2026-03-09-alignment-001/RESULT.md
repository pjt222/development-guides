## Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Decomposition | Lead identified 10 most recent skills via git log. Created 3 subtasks mapped to member specialties |

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lead decomposes task | **PASS** | Skill-reviewer identified 10 skills via git log (commits 1b7fefd6 through b91a8191), created subtasks for 3 members |
| 2 | 4 distinct subtasks | **PASS** | senior-researcher (standards compliance), senior-software-developer (structural review), librarian (registry integrity), skill-reviewer (synthesis). Each clearly labeled with `[MEMBER — Specialty]` headers |
| 3 | Independent member work | **PASS** | Each member section covers non-overlapping dimensions. Senior-researcher: frontmatter fields. Senior-software-developer: sections, step format, line counts. Librarian: registry entries, symlinks |
| 4 | Lead synthesizes report | **PASS** | Single unified report with per-skill compliance table, categorized findings (BLOCKING/SUGGEST/NIT), and prioritized recommendations |
| 5 | 10 skills identified | **PASS** | Exactly 10 skills: test-team-coordination, create-github-issues, review-codebase, develop-gc-method, develop-hplc-method, interpret-chromatogram, interpret-ir-spectrum, interpret-mass-spectrum, interpret-nmr-spectrum, interpret-raman-spectrum. Identified by commit date |
| 6 | Compliance table produced | **PASS** | Per-skill table with columns: Skill, Frontmatter, Sections, Procedure Format, Line Count, Registry, Symlink, Overall |
| 7 | Genuine findings (>=3) | **PASS** | 3 findings: (1) review-codebase non-standard `## Scaling with Rest` section, (2) create-github-issues 4 procedure steps (below recommended 5), (3) CRLF line endings across library |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | **PASS** | Symlink audit incorporated as separate section in librarian's review and in the synthesis. All 10 symlinks verified present |
| 9 | Findings are actionable | **PASS** | Each finding has specific fix: (1) fold section content into Common Pitfalls, (2) noted as self-resolving in future iterations, (3) add `.gitattributes` rule |
| 10 | No false positives (>=80%) | **PASS** | All 3 findings verified against disk. The non-standard section exists at line 146 of review-codebase. The step count is 4. CRLF confirmed (257 of 298 files) |

**Summary**: 10/10 criteria met. **Exceeds threshold (7/10).**

## Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Decomposition Quality | 5/5 | Lead identified skills systematically via git log (not guessing), created subtasks precisely mapped to member specialties. The 3-member + lead decomposition matches the team's defined structure exactly |
| Member Specialization | 4/5 | Each member produced domain-appropriate output. Senior-researcher checked all 10 metadata subfields (6 per skill = 60 checks). Senior-software-developer produced step/line count tables. Librarian checked registry entries and symlinks. Slight overlap: both senior-researcher and senior-software-developer touch frontmatter, but from different angles (field presence vs structural patterns) |
| Synthesis Quality | 5/5 | Seamless unified report. Per-skill table with 7 columns and 10 rows. Findings categorized into BLOCKING (0), SUGGEST (1), NIT (2). Summary with immediate and follow-on recommendations. No seams between member contributions visible |
| Finding Accuracy | 4/5 | All findings verified accurate. The audit correctly identified that these 10 recently-added skills are in strong compliance. The 3 findings found are genuine (non-standard section, low step count, CRLF). Slight deduction: audit could have gone deeper — e.g., checking whether Expected/On failure blocks have substantive content, not just existence |
| Adaptation Grace | 4/5 | Symlink audit smoothly incorporated into the librarian's review section. No friction or restart. The scope change was natural for the librarian's existing registry-auditing role |
| **Total** | **22/25** | |

## Ground Truth Verification

| Fact | Expected Value | Verified | Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Total skills in registry | 299 | YES | Confirmed via grep |
| Required frontmatter fields | name, description, allowed-tools, metadata | YES | All 10 checked |
| Required metadata fields | author, version, domain, complexity, language, tags | YES | All 60 checks pass |
| Required sections | 6 (When to Use through Related Skills) | YES | All 10 have all 6 |
| Max line count | 500 | YES | Max found: 217 (test-team-coordination) |
| Procedure step pattern | Expected + On failure | YES | Every step in all 10 skills has both blocks |
| Symlink directory | .claude/skills/ | YES | All 10 have symlinks |

## Key Observations

1. **Hub-and-spoke produced clean separation of concerns**: Each member's section covered a distinct audit dimension with no duplication. The senior-researcher's frontmatter check was about field presence and correctness. The senior-software-developer's structural check was about section ordering, step format, and line counts. The librarian's registry check was about catalog consistency. These are genuinely non-overlapping perspectives on the same artifacts.

2. **The audit found the library is well-maintained**: 10 recently-added skills all pass compliance with only 1 SUGGEST and 2 NITs. This is a positive finding — it validates that the skill creation process (likely using the create-skill meta-skill) is producing consistent output. The hub-and-spoke pattern successfully confirmed quality rather than discovering major defects.

3. **The CRLF finding is a library-wide discovery**: The senior-software-developer's finding that 257/298 files use CRLF line endings is a genuine cross-cutting insight that transcends the 10-skill audit scope. The `.gitattributes` recommendation is actionable and would prevent future drift. This demonstrates that format audits can surface systemic issues beyond their immediate scope.

4. **The non-standard section in review-codebase is a real format violation**: The `## Scaling with Rest` section between Validation and Common Pitfalls breaks the six-section standard. The suggested fix (fold into Common Pitfalls) is specific and correct. This is the kind of finding the agentskills-alignment team is designed to catch.

5. **10 skills was the right audit scope**: Large enough to represent diversity (3 domains: review, git, chromatography, spectroscopy) but small enough for thorough per-skill analysis. The team examined every frontmatter field, every section, every procedure step, and every registry entry.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hub-and-spoke is effective for structured audits**: The pattern's strength is decomposing a well-defined task into parallel independent subtasks. Format auditing maps naturally to this pattern because each compliance dimension (standards, structure, registry) is genuinely independent.

2. **Strong compliance is itself a finding**: The audit's most important finding may be that the library is maintaining quality across new additions. This validates the infrastructure (create-skill template, CI validation, review process) rather than exposing defects.

3. **Scope changes that align with existing member roles integrate smoothly**: The symlink audit scope change was absorbed by the librarian — the team member whose existing role (registry integrity) most naturally includes symlink verification. This suggests that scope changes aligned with member specialties create less friction than those requiring role reassignment.

4. **The lead's synthesis step adds value even when findings are sparse**: The categorization into BLOCKING/SUGGEST/NIT, the per-skill compliance table, and the prioritized recommendations demonstrate that synthesis is valuable even when individual member findings are minimal. The lead transforms "10 skills pass, 3 minor issues" into a structured, actionable report.
