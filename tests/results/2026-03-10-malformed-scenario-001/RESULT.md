## Run: 2026-03-10-malformed-scenario-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 1m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-negative-malformed-scenario |
| Test Level | negative |
| Target | test-team-coordination |
| Category | F |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Fixture creation | `_malformed-fixture.md` written to `tests/scenarios/negative/` with valid YAML frontmatter but missing `## Acceptance Criteria` section |
| Frontmatter parsing | YAML parsed successfully: target=opaque-team, coordination-pattern=adaptive, team-size=3, version=1.0 |
| Step 1.3 validation | Scanned for 6 required sections. Found 5: Objective, Pre-conditions, Task, Expected Behaviors, Observation Protocol. **Missing: Acceptance Criteria** |
| Abort decision | Per On failure block: "abort with an error message identifying the missing file or malformed section" — validation gate triggers |
| No execution | Steps 2-7 never reached. No pre-condition checks, no team spawn, no result directory created |
| Cleanup | `_malformed-fixture.md` deleted after test |

### Section Validation Detail

| Required Section | Present? |
|-----------------|----------|
| Objective | YES (line 18) |
| Pre-conditions | YES (line 22) |
| Task | YES (line 26, with Primary Task at line 28) |
| Expected Behaviors | YES (line 32) |
| Acceptance Criteria | **NO — MISSING** |
| Observation Protocol | YES (line 38) |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Step 1.3 detects missing section | PASS | Section scan found 5/6 required sections. "Acceptance Criteria" explicitly identified as the missing section. |
| 2 | Abort before Step 2 | PASS | No pre-condition checks were performed. Steps 2-7 never executed. The validation gate at Step 1.3 is the termination point. |
| 3 | No result directory created | PASS | No new directory in `tests/results/` for this fixture. The RESULT.md being written here documents the *negative test observation*, not the fixture's execution. |
| 4 | Error message is human-readable | PASS | Clear message: "Missing required section: Acceptance Criteria. Scenario file has 5 of 6 required sections." Not a stack trace or cryptic error code. |
| 5 | Frontmatter parses successfully | PASS | YAML extracted: target=opaque-team, coordination-pattern=adaptive, team-size=3. Parsing succeeded — the error is structural (missing body section), not syntactic. |
| 6 | Missing section named explicitly | PASS | Error names "Acceptance Criteria" specifically, not a generic "missing section" message. The section validation table enumerates all 6 sections with present/absent status. |
| 7 | Fixture cleaned up | PASS | `_malformed-fixture.md` deleted after test completion. `ls tests/scenarios/negative/` confirms only 5 permanent scenario files remain. |

**Passed**: 7/7 | **Threshold**: 5/7 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Key Observations

- **Validation gate works as designed**: Step 1.3 of the test-team-coordination skill correctly identifies the missing section and aborts before any execution steps. The "On failure" block's instruction to "abort with an error message identifying the missing file or malformed section" is satisfied.
- **YAML-body separation is clean**: The frontmatter parses without error; the body validation is a separate check. This means partial failures (valid metadata, invalid structure) produce useful diagnostic output — you know *what* is missing, not just that something failed.
- **Fixture pattern is reusable**: The `_malformed-fixture.md` pattern (underscore prefix signals transient test fixture, not a real scenario) works well. The fixture is created, tested against, and cleaned up in one flow.
- **No false passes possible**: Because the validation is structural (section heading scan), it cannot be fooled by content that merely *mentions* acceptance criteria in prose — the `## Acceptance Criteria` heading must exist as a markdown section.

### Lessons Learned

- The test-team-coordination skill's Step 1.3 is a genuine validation gate, not a soft warning
- Negative tests of the test framework itself are fast (<1 minute) and provide concrete evidence of defensive behavior
- Underscore-prefixed fixtures (`_malformed-fixture.md`) are a clean pattern for transient test data that should not persist
