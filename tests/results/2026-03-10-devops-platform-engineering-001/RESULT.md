### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Four distinct work streams | PASS | Four separate agents produced four separate reports: CI/CD audit (13,846 chars), ML assessment (16,395 chars), supply chain audit (15,985 chars), DX assessment (14,649 chars). Each structured as an independent document. |
| 2 | No sequential dependencies | PASS | All 4 agents launched simultaneously via parallel Agent tool calls. No agent's output references another agent's in-progress work. Each read the workflow files independently. |
| 3 | Lead integration | PASS | Observer performed lead synthesis: identified 3 cross-cutting themes (action version pinning flagged by both devops and security, CI duplication found by both architect and devops, permission scoping noted by security and devops). Conflicts resolved (devops rated tag-pinning CRITICAL, security rated it HIGH — resolved to CRITICAL given combined evidence). |
| 4 | Work partitioned | PASS | Zero overlap: devops covered CI maturity/caching/consolidation, mlops covered ML readiness/MCP architecture, security covered supply chain/GITHUB_TOKEN/dependency integrity, architect covered DX/onboarding/symlinks/npm scripts. Each stayed in their lane. |
| 5 | Factually accurate CI/CD findings | PASS | 5+ findings verifiable against actual files: (1) validate-integrity.yml has 10 checks A1-A5/B1-B5 (verified), (2) skills-ref pinned to 752b29a0a1a1 (verified in validate-skills.yml:26), (3) deploy-pages.yml uses OIDC pattern with pages:write + id-token:write (verified), (4) update-readmes.yml auto-commit action SHA-pinned to 04702edda (verified), (5) npm test runs validate:integrity + check-readmes (verified in package.json). |
| 6 | Security domain covered | PASS | 3 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM + 2 LOW supply chain findings. Specifically: mutable tag pinning risk with blast radius analysis, abbreviated SHA collision vector for pip install, auto-commit scope broader than necessary, missing persist-credentials:false on read-only workflows. |
| 7 | DX domain covered | PASS | 3 MAJOR + 3 MODERATE DX findings: duplicated CI/local validation logic (validate-integrity.yml vs validate-integrity.sh), no CONTRIBUTING.md for external contributors, manual symlink maintenance burden for 299 skills, inconsistent npm script naming (kebab vs colon). |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | PARTIAL | The scope change (include validate-integrity.yml in review + consolidation recommendation) was pre-injected in the task prompt since background agents cannot receive mid-execution triggers. All 4 agents reviewed validate-integrity.yml. The devops-engineer produced a detailed consolidation trade-off analysis recommending "keep separate" with 4 specific arguments. However, the scope change was not injected mid-flight as the scenario specifies. |
| 9 | Consolidation recommendation | PASS | DevOps engineer produced a detailed trade-off analysis with 4 arguments for consolidation and 4 against (which prevail). Key insight: trigger paths differ meaningfully — a matrix strategy would union all paths, causing unnecessary validation runs. Also noted: different tooling dependencies (Python for skills-ref vs shell-only for integrity/tests). |
| 10 | Severity prioritization | PASS | Each member used severity rankings. DevOps: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW. Security: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with numbered priorities. Architect: MAJOR/MODERATE. MLOps: priority-ordered findings with effort estimates. Cross-team integration applied unified severity. |
| 11 | Actionable recommendations | PASS | 15+ specific, implementable suggestions across all members. Top 3: (1) Pin all actions to full 40-char commit SHAs (security + devops), (2) CI workflow should call bash scripts/validate-integrity.sh instead of reimplementing (architect), (3) Add timeout-minutes to all 5 workflows (devops). Each includes code snippets. |

**Passed**: 10/11 (1 PARTIAL) | **Threshold**: 8/11 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Parallelism fidelity | 5/5 | All 4 agents launched simultaneously, zero inter-member dependencies, zero sequential waiting. Each agent read workflow files independently without referencing others' output. The parallel pattern was genuinely executed, not simulated. |
| Domain specificity | 5/5 | Perfect domain separation: devops (CI/CD maturity + caching + consolidation), mlops (ML readiness + MCP architecture + experiment tracking), security (supply chain + action provenance + secret handling), architect (DX + contributor onboarding + symlink architecture). Zero domain overlap. |
| Integration quality | 4/5 | Cross-cutting themes identified (action pinning flagged by both devops and security, CI duplication found by both architect and devops). Severity conflict resolved (CRITICAL vs HIGH → CRITICAL). Could have produced a more formal unified report document rather than observer-level synthesis. |
| Factual accuracy | 5/5 | All findings verified against actual workflow files. Correct identification of: 5 workflows, checkout@v6 across all, skills-ref SHA pin, OIDC pages deploy, npm cache configuration, validate-integrity.sh 10-check structure. No false positives. |
| Scope adaptation | 4/5 | Consolidation recommendation produced with detailed trade-offs. validate-integrity.yml reviewed by all members. But scope change was pre-injected rather than mid-flight (framework limitation for background agents), reducing the adaptation test fidelity. |

**Total**: 23/25

### Key Observations

- **60,875 total characters across 4 parallel reports**: This is the highest combined output for any single test scenario. The parallel pattern maximizes throughput — 4 deep analyses in the time of 1.
- **Convergent finding: action version pinning**: Both the devops-engineer (CRITICAL) and security-analyst (HIGH-1) independently flagged the `@v6` tag pinning risk. The devops-engineer additionally noted that `@v6` does not exist for checkout (current stable is v4), elevating this from a pinning best-practice issue to a correctness issue. This convergence from independent analysis increases confidence.
- **Convergent finding: CI/local validation divergence**: Both the architect (MAJOR-1) and devops-engineer (H2, noting update-readmes lacks validation gate) identified validation logic issues from different angles. The architect found the code-level duplication; the devops-engineer found the missing validation gate in the auto-commit flow.
- **MLOps finding reframes the test framework**: The ML assessment identified that `results.yml` already has an ML-ready schema — rubric scores as training targets, acceptance criteria as multi-label classification — and proposed an embedding-based similarity scorer using the existing hf-mcp-server as an immediate next step. This is a genuinely novel strategic recommendation.
- **Architect's #1 recommendation is the highest-impact single change**: "CI workflow should invoke `bash scripts/validate-integrity.sh` instead of reimplementing" — a 1-hour fix that eliminates a class of divergence bugs across the entire validation pipeline.

### Lessons Learned

- The parallel coordination pattern produces genuinely independent, non-overlapping analyses when team members have clearly distinct domains — the 4-way domain partition (CI/CD, ML, security, DX) maps cleanly to the 4 agents
- Parallel execution maximizes throughput at the cost of integration quality — the lead synthesis step is where value is created but also where depth is lost (observer-level integration vs. a dedicated lead agent)
- Background agents cannot receive scope change triggers mid-flight — this is a structural limitation of the test framework that affects all parallel and background agent scenarios
- Team output volume (60K+ chars) far exceeds any single agent — but volume alone is not value; the convergent findings (action pinning, CI duplication) that emerge from independent analysis are the true signal
- The MLOps engineer's assessment of a docs-only repo was the most creative adaptation — finding ML relevance in a non-ML project through the experiment-tracking lens
