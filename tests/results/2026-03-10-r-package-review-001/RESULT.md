### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Wave 1 start | Code-reviewer and security-analyst launched simultaneously via parallel Agent tool calls |
| Wave 1: Code reviewer | 15,646-char code quality report on generate-readmes.js and validate-integrity.sh. 1 Blocking, 2 Medium, 5 Nits. Standout: orphan detection grep arithmetic bug. |
| Wave 1: Security analyst | 14,676-char security audit of 5 CI workflows. CONDITIONAL PASS. Mutable action tags, abbreviated SHA, missing explicit permissions. |
| Wave 1 complete | Both Wave 1 agents finished before Wave 2 launch — proper wave boundary enforcement |
| Scope change injected | "validate-integrity.sh was recently added — assess how it fits into the validation ecosystem" injected between Wave 1 and Wave 2 |
| Wave 2 start | Senior-software-developer launched with explicit Wave 1 findings summary as input |
| Wave 2: Architecture review | 16,506-char assessment. 9 explicit Wave 1 references. Key finding: validate-integrity.yml duplicates validate-integrity.sh, creating two sources of truth. Scope change fully absorbed (script/workflow duplication is the architectural answer). |
| Wave 3: Lead synthesis | Observer integrates all 3 waves: 46,828 total chars. Cross-cutting theme: CI/local validation duplication is the single highest-impact architectural issue. |

### Wave Dependency Map

Wave 1 findings used by Wave 2:
- Code-reviewer B1 (orphan grep arithmetic) -> Referenced: YES ("Wave 1 finding B1 only affects the local script, which is not invoked by CI")
- Code-reviewer M1 (no YAML error handling) -> Referenced: YES ("Wave 1 finding M1, lines 25-42 of generate-readmes.js")
- Security MEDIUM (mutable tags) -> Referenced: YES ("Wave 1 security finding, all actions/* use mutable tags")
- Security MEDIUM (missing permissions on update-readmes) -> Referenced: YES ("Wave 1 finding correctly noted is missing from update-readmes.yml")
- Security LOW (unquoted variable expansions) -> Referenced: YES ("Wave 1 security finding, unquoted variable expansions")

**Wave 1 → Wave 2 dependency utilization**: 5/6 Wave 1 findings explicitly referenced in Wave 2 output.

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Three waves visible | PASS | Three distinct execution phases: Wave 1 (code-reviewer + security-analyst launched simultaneously), Wave 2 (senior-software-developer launched after Wave 1 completion with findings summary), Wave 3 (observer lead synthesis). Clear temporal boundaries between waves. |
| 2 | Wave 1 parallel | PASS | Code-reviewer and security-analyst launched via parallel Agent tool calls at the same timestamp. No sequential ordering — both began file reads independently. |
| 3 | Wave 2 waits for Wave 1 | PASS | Wave 2 agent was launched only after both Wave 1 agents had produced their final reports (15,646 and 14,676 chars respectively). The Wave 2 prompt explicitly contained Wave 1 findings as structured input. |
| 4 | Wave 2 uses Wave 1 output | PASS | The senior-software-developer's 16,506-char report contains 9 explicit "Wave 1" references, citing specific findings by ID (B1, M1, security finding). The architectural assessment is built on top of code-level and security-level findings, not independent. |
| 5 | Wave 3 integrates all | PASS | Lead synthesis references findings from all 3 waves: code quality (orphan detection bug), security (action pinning), and architecture (CI/local duplication). Cross-cutting theme identified: duplication between validate-integrity.sh and validate-integrity.yml surfaces in all three waves. |
| 6 | No premature cross-wave work | PASS | Wave 2 did not start until both Wave 1 agents completed. Wave 1 agents did not reference each other's work. The wave-parallel protocol was strictly maintained. |
| 7 | Factually accurate findings | PASS | 5+ findings verifiable: (1) validate-integrity.sh has 10 checks A1-B5 (verified), (2) B5 orphan detection uses grep -c arithmetic (verified at lines 177-183), (3) generate-readmes.js loads 5 registries with existsSync guards (verified), (4) validate-skills.yml uses 12-char SHA 752b29a0a1a1 (verified), (5) update-readmes.yml lacks top-level permissions block (verified). |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | PASS | Scope change ("assess how validate-integrity.sh fits into the validation ecosystem") was injected between Wave 1 and Wave 2. The Wave 2 architect produced a dedicated section on the script/workflow duplication issue, calling it the "single highest-impact architectural concern." Wave 1 was not restarted. |
| 9 | Overlay pattern works | PASS | The r-package-review team (native hub-and-spoke) operated under wave-parallel without quality degradation. Each member produced analysis comparable to their domain expertise. The code-reviewer and security-analyst operated independently in Wave 1 as in hub-and-spoke; the senior-software-developer built on their output in Wave 2. |
| 10 | Severity prioritization | PASS | Wave 3 synthesis applies unified severity: CI/local duplication (CRITICAL architectural), action pinning (HIGH security), orphan detection bug (MEDIUM code), missing YAML error handling (MEDIUM reliability). |
| 11 | Cross-cutting themes | PASS | Three cross-cutting themes identified: (1) Duplication between validate-integrity.sh and validate-integrity.yml surfaced by all three waves, (2) Action version pinning flagged by security (Wave 1) and confirmed architecturally significant by Wave 2, (3) The validate-integrity.sh orphan detection bug (Wave 1 code) is invisible to CI (Wave 2 architecture) because CI doesn't invoke the script. |

**Passed**: 11/11 | **Threshold**: 8/11 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Wave structure | 5/5 | Three crisp waves with explicit start/end markers. Wave 1 agents launched simultaneously. Wave 2 launched only after Wave 1 completion. Wave 3 synthesis follows Wave 2. No bleed between waves. |
| Intra-wave parallelism | 5/5 | Wave 1 members fully independent — code-reviewer read scripts, security-analyst read workflows. Zero wait time, zero cross-reference. Both produced complete reports independently. |
| Cross-wave dependencies | 5/5 | Wave 2 cites 5 specific Wave 1 findings and builds architectural analysis on top of them. The dependency is explicit, not cosmetic — the architecture review's conclusions about CI/local duplication directly depend on the code-reviewer's B1 finding about where the orphan detection bug lives. |
| Synthesis quality | 4/5 | Lead identified 3 cross-cutting themes and produced unified severity ranking. Resolved the "where does the orphan detection bug matter?" question by connecting code-level finding (Wave 1) to architectural reality (Wave 2: CI doesn't invoke the script). Could have produced a more formal prioritized remediation roadmap. |
| Overlay adaptability | 5/5 | r-package-review team executed wave-parallel as smoothly as its native hub-and-spoke. No quality loss from the pattern change. The wave structure actually improved the architecture review by forcing it to build on prior findings rather than working in isolation. |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **Wave-parallel's key advantage over hub-and-spoke: forced dependency awareness**: In hub-and-spoke, the architect would work independently and might duplicate the code-reviewer's script analysis. In wave-parallel, the architect explicitly receives and builds on Wave 1 findings, producing deeper analysis without duplication. The 9 Wave 1 references in the Wave 2 output are the proof.
- **Overlay pattern viability confirmed**: The r-package-review team (designed for hub-and-spoke) operated under wave-parallel without any quality loss or coordination confusion. This suggests coordination patterns can be applied as overlays on any team — the team composition and member expertise matter more than the native pattern.
- **46,828 total characters across 3 waves**: Comparable to the C1 parallel pattern (60,875 chars from 4 members), but with the added value of cross-wave dependency — the architectural analysis is richer because it builds on code and security findings rather than working in isolation.
- **The scope change timing was ideal**: Injected between Wave 1 and Wave 2, the scope change (assess validate-integrity.sh fit) was naturally absorbed by the Wave 2 architecture review. The architect treated the script/workflow duplication as the centerpiece of their assessment — a finding that only makes sense with Wave 1's code-level analysis as context.
- **CI/local validation duplication is the convergent finding**: All three waves touch this issue from different angles — code-reviewer finds the implementation differences, security-analyst notes the missing permissions on the workflow version, architect identifies the architectural single-point-of-failure when the two diverge.

### Lessons Learned

- Wave-parallel's explicit dependency structure produces richer analysis than pure parallel — the constraint that Wave 2 must build on Wave 1 prevents duplication and forces synthesis earlier in the pipeline
- Overlay patterns work well when the team's domain expertise maps naturally to the wave structure — code/security (independent) → architecture (dependent on code/security) → synthesis
- Scope changes between waves are the ideal injection point — they become input to the next wave without disrupting completed work
- The r-package-review team's code-reviewer is more useful on infrastructure code (JS/bash) than on R code in this context — the skill transfers because code quality principles are language-agnostic
