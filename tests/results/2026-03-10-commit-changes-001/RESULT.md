## Run: 2026-03-10-commit-changes-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 2m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-commit-changes-dryrun |
| Test Level | skill |
| Target | commit-changes |
| Category | E |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Step 1 (Review) | `git status` executed: 1 modified file (tests/results/results.yml), 3 untracked binary files (peon-ping-sound.wav, .peon-ping-icon.png, .peon-toast.xml), 5 untracked test result directories |
| Step 1 (Review) | `git diff --staged` confirmed empty — no staged changes |
| Step 1 (Review) | `git diff` showed 203 lines added to results.yml (5 new scenario entries + coverage updates) |
| Scope change | Binary file assessment: peon-ping-sound.wav (169KB audio) should NOT be committed to docs-only repo |
| Step 2 (Staging analysis) | Staging plan: STAGE results.yml + 5 RESULT.md directories; EXCLUDE all 3 binary files |
| Step 3 (Message draft) | Conventional commit drafted: `feat(tests): add batch 1 test results for 5 scenarios` |

### Read-Only Verification

| Command | Executed? | Write Op? |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| git status | Yes | No |
| git diff | Yes | No |
| git diff --staged | Yes | No |
| git add | No | N/A (not executed) |
| git commit | No | N/A (not executed) |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Git status executed | PASS | `git status` output captured showing modified file, 3 untracked binaries, 5 untracked result directories |
| 2 | Untracked file identified | PASS | `peon-ping-sound.wav` explicitly identified with size (169KB) and type (binary audio). Also found bonus untracked: .peon-ping-icon.png (11KB) and .peon-toast.xml (270B) |
| 3 | No staged changes confirmed | PASS | `git diff --staged` returned empty output — correctly reported as "no staged changes" |
| 4 | Staging plan produced | PASS | Two-category plan: STAGE (results.yml + 5 RESULT.md directories — test execution data), EXCLUDE (3 binary files — not documentation content) with rationale for each |
| 5 | Commit message drafted | PASS | `feat(tests): add batch 1 test results for 5 scenarios` — conventional commit format with feat() type prefix |
| 6 | Read-only compliance | PASS | No git write operations executed. Only `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --staged` used. Verification table confirms zero write ops. |
| 7 | Message explains "why" | PASS | Body: "Execute and record results for 5 test scenarios: advocatus-diaboli (10/10, 25/25), security-analyst (9/10, 25/25), janitor (7/10, 24/25), empty-target (6/7), stale-registry (7/7). All pass. Updates results.yml with coverage tracking." |
| 8 | Binary file assessment | PASS | Scope change addressed: peon-ping-sound.wav should NOT be committed because (1) repo is docs-only, (2) binary files bloat git history irreversibly, (3) not in .gitignore, (4) should be gitignored or relocated |
| 9 | HEREDOC format used | PASS | Draft uses HEREDOC pattern from the commit-changes skill |

**Passed**: 9/9 | **Threshold**: 7/9 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 3 requested steps (Review, Stage analysis, Message draft) fully executed with all sub-commands. Step 1 ran git status, git diff, and git diff --staged. Step 2 produced categorized staging plan. Step 3 produced conventional commit message. |
| Read-Only Discipline | 5/5 | Strictly read-only throughout. No git add, git commit, git reset, or any other write operations. Clear separation between analysis and execution maintained. Read-only verification table produced. |
| Change Detection | 5/5 | Full status analysis: identified modified tracked file (results.yml with 203 lines diff), 3 untracked binary files with sizes and types, 5 untracked result directories. Distinguished between modified/staged/untracked correctly. |
| Message Quality | 5/5 | Precise type (feat), scoped subject (tests), clear body with specific scenario names and scores, Co-Authored-By tag, HEREDOC format. Body explains purpose (test execution recording), not just the diff. |
| Scope Change Handling | 4/5 | Binary file assessment addressed 4 clear points (repo purpose, git history bloat, missing gitignore, recommendation). Could have explored alternatives (Git LFS, separate asset repo) for completeness. |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **Perfect read-only compliance**: The core challenge of this scenario — executing analysis steps without producing side effects — was handled cleanly. No accidental writes.
- **Current state richer than ground truth**: The scenario expected only peon-ping-sound.wav as untracked. The actual state included 2 additional peon-ping files and 5 test result directories from the current session. The procedure adapted correctly to the richer state.
- **Staging plan demonstrates judgment**: The two-category plan (stage test results, exclude binaries) shows appropriate decision-making about what belongs in a commit vs. what should be gitignored.
- **Conventional commit format is natural**: The feat(tests) prefix with scoped subject is the correct format for adding test results to this project.

### Lessons Learned

- Dry-run mode is a valid way to test skill procedures without side effects — useful for any skill that normally modifies state
- The commit-changes skill's analytical steps (1-3) are independently valuable even without execution
- Binary file policy decisions should be documented in .gitignore before they become recurring findings
