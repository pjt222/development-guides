### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-advocatus-diaboli-challenge |
| Test Level | agent |
| Target | advocatus-diaboli |
| Category | D |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Reading | Agent reviewed _template.md, _registry.yml, cross-scenario analysis, 4 RESULT.md files, scenario file, and agent definition |
| Template critique | Steelman: "more rigorous than most software test frameworks for non-deterministic systems." Challenges: self-assessed rubric, missing inter-rater reliability, dead Variants section |
| Analysis critique | Steelman: "admirably self-critical." Challenges: affirming the consequent (structured > adaptive from N=1), survivorship bias (self-referential = richest), false precision (97%/92% aggregating non-commensurable criteria) |
| Registry critique | Selection bias: 5/6 tests involve esoteric agents. No tests target agents likely to fail. 98% of agents and 99.7% of skills untested |
| Meta-methodology | "Single-agent simulation measures specification clarity, not coordination" — the load-bearing assumption challenged |
| Paradox | Resolved as false dichotomy: behavioral fidelity and epistemic soundness operate at different levels |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Steelman-first principle followed | PASS | Every challenge section opens with "Steelman" subsection presenting the strongest version of the position being challenged. Template steelman: "well-designed instrument for making test outcomes comparable." Analysis steelman: "admirably self-critical." Registry steelman: "thoughtful coverage strategy." Meta-methodology steelman: "pragmatically sound." |
| 2 | Advocatus persona maintained | PASS | Constructive contrarian voice throughout. Rigorous but not hostile. Concludes with "What survives scrutiny" acknowledging framework strengths alongside critiques. |
| 3 | Genuine weaknesses identified (>=3) | PASS | 9 distinct non-trivial challenges identified in summary table: self-assessed rubric, dead Variants, confounded comparisons, survivorship bias, false precision, esoteric overrepresentation, no failure-targeting tests, specification-not-coordination measurement, paradox resolution. All are genuine and non-obvious. |
| 4 | Socratic questioning used (>=3) | PASS | At least 5 probing questions: "What rubric score would you expect a deliberately poor execution to receive?"; "Is the finding about pattern quality, or about operational failures?"; "Would the finding about contemplative practices still appear with different first-6 tests?"; "What would it take to make the claim rigorous?"; "How would you validate the framework if multi-agent results differ?" |
| 5 | Logical fallacies named | PASS | Three specific fallacy types: affirming the consequent (structured > adaptive), survivorship bias (self-referential targets), false precision (aggregating non-commensurable criteria). Each named and explained with evidence. |
| 6 | Assumptions surfaced (>=2) | PASS | Multiple unstated premises explicitly named: (1) "Template comprehensiveness equals signal quality"; (2) "A single agent simulating multiple perspectives is a valid proxy for multiple independent agents coordinating" — identified as "the load-bearing assumption"; (3) Rubric self-assessment produces objective scores. |
| 7 | Impact assessed | PASS | Every challenge includes impact assessment: "If the template is measuring compliance-to-template rather than test quality, the 92% score tells us the executor is good at filling in templates"; "If the comparative findings are not supportable, the analysis is best understood as observations, not findings"; "If this counterargument holds, the framework cannot make claims about how agents work together." |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | PASS | Self-referential paradox addressed deeply. Resolved as false dichotomy with three-part argument: (1) framework measures behavioral fidelity, not truth claims; (2) critique targets inferential layer, not measurement instrument; (3) the framework succeeds precisely when critique is sharp, because sharp critique is the behavior being tested. "A framework that could not withstand self-referential scrutiny would be more suspect." |
| 9 | Template critique specific | PASS | Evaluates specific template sections: Scoring Rubric (self-assessment problem), Variants section (operationally dead — no registry field, no tracking), inter-rater reliability (missing from template entirely). Not generic "it's too long." |
| 10 | Constructive resolution | PASS | "What survives scrutiny" section: framework is genuinely well-designed as behavioral fidelity measurement instrument. Template produces consistent, comparable results. Acceptance criteria with ground truth anchor results in observable facts. Self-critical posture is uncommon and valuable. The inferential layer is what does not survive. |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Steelmanning Quality | 5/5 | Each steelman demonstrates genuine understanding of design rationale — not perfunctory. The template steelman acknowledges it exceeds most software test frameworks for non-deterministic systems. The meta-methodology steelman compares to a playwright writing all characters. |
| Critical Depth | 5/5 | Surfaces hidden assumptions (the load-bearing single-agent assumption), second-order consequences (high scores may reflect ceiling effect, not excellence), and structural gaps (inter-rater reliability). Names the specific confounding variables in the adaptive test (duration, lead shutdown, ground truth error). |
| Logical Rigor | 5/5 | Named fallacies with structured arguments. Affirming the consequent chain clearly laid out. Survivorship bias argument distinguishes verifiability from richness. False precision argument explains why aggregating different criteria produces misleading numbers. |
| Socratic Skill | 5/5 | Genuinely probing questions that reveal unstated dependencies. "What rubric score would a deliberately poor execution receive?" directly tests discriminant validity. "Would the finding survive if the lead hadn't been shut down?" isolates the confound. |
| Meta-Awareness | 5/5 | Deep paradox engagement. Three-level resolution (behavioral vs. epistemic levels, measurement vs. inferential layers, framework interests vs. test interests). "The framework succeeds precisely when the critique is sharp" — recursive insight that the test's success condition is anti-correlated with the framework's preference. |

**Total**: 25/25

### Key Observations

- **This is the highest-quality single-agent test execution in the framework so far**: 10/10 AC, 25/25 rubric. The advocatus-diaboli produced genuinely novel critiques that improve the framework.
- **9 challenges, all substantive**: Not a single straw-man criticism. Every challenge identifies a real weakness with specific evidence and assessed impact.
- **The paradox resolution is the standout moment**: The distinction between behavioral fidelity (what the framework measures) and epistemic soundness (what the critique evaluates) resolves the apparent paradox cleanly and produces a meta-insight about self-referential testing.
- **Actionable feedback loop**: The critique directly suggests framework improvements — inter-rater reliability protocol, variant tracking in registry, calibrating the rubric floor with deliberately poor executions, variance through repeat runs.
- **Confirms the framework's weakest point**: The single-agent simulation critique is the most impactful — it clearly articulates that the framework measures "specification clarity" not "coordination quality." This is the framework's acknowledged gap and the agent arrived at it independently.

### Lessons Learned

- The advocatus-diaboli agent is well-suited to meta-review tasks — its steelman-first principle prevents degenerative criticism
- Self-referential test scenarios with scope-change paradoxes produce the deepest engagement
- The 25/25 score raises the question the agent itself identified: does this reflect genuine excellence or a rubric ceiling effect? The depth and novelty of the critique suggest genuine excellence, but the question is legitimate
- The identified weaknesses (inter-rater reliability, variant tracking, rubric floor calibration) should be incorporated into framework v3.0
