## Analysis by Coordination Pattern

| Pattern | Scenarios | Avg Rubric % | Key Finding |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Adaptive | #1 | 73% | Self-organizing is fragile — no fallback when lead fails |
| Hub-and-spoke | #2, #25, #27 | 89% | Best for multi-perspective tasks; one FAIL due to scenario design error |
| Sequential | #5 | 100% | Cumulative insight progression; depends on handoff quality |
| Reciprocal | #4 | 100% | Deepest analysis per team size; witness role is a novel mechanism |
| Parallel | #20 | 92% | Highest combined output (60,875 chars); convergent findings validate parallelism |
| Wave-parallel | #22 | 96% | Cross-wave information flow works; overlay on hub-and-spoke team confirmed |
| Timeboxed | #28 | 96% | All 5 Scrum events executed; scope change handled via Sprint Goal alignment |

**All 7 patterns now tested.** The structured patterns (sequential, reciprocal, wave-parallel, timeboxed) consistently outperform adaptive. The adaptive pattern's 73% rubric score is an outlier — all others are 92%+.

## Analysis by Test Level

| Level | Count | Pass Rate | Avg Rubric % | What It Reveals |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Team | 8 | 8/8 (100%) | 93% | Coordination overhead visible; smaller teams outperform |
| Agent | 7 | 7/7 (100%) | 95% | Persona fidelity strong; agents internalize skills beyond explicit listing |
| Skill | 8 | 8/8 (100%) | 96% | Procedures transfer across domains; compliance skills work on software |
| Negative | 5 | 4/5 (80%) | 90% | First FAIL: scenario design error exposed, not team quality failure |
| Integration | 3 | 3/3 (100%) | 97% | Highest avg score; composition is the system's strength |

**Key insight**: Integration tests (skill-in-agent, agent-in-team, multi-skill-chain) scored highest. The system's primary value proposition — that skills compose within agents, agents compose within teams — is validated.

## The FAIL: Scenario Design Error (#25)

The only FAIL (test-negative-conflicting-findings) resulted from a scenario ground truth error, not a team quality failure:

- **Expected**: Security-analyst and senior-software-developer disagree on js-yaml risk, requiring lead conflict resolution
- **Actual**: js-yaml 4.1.1 has zero active CVEs; both reviewers correctly converged on "low risk with defense-in-depth"
- **Root cause**: Scenario incorrectly described js-yaml as a "runtime dependency" (it's a devDependency); assumed CVEs that don't exist
- **Lesson**: Negative test scenarios require verified ground truth — you can't engineer a conflict from a non-existent vulnerability

This is a valuable meta-finding: the test framework's ground truth verification step (from the original cross-scenario analysis) would have prevented this FAIL.

## Emergent Cross-Scenario Findings

### 1. Self-referential targets remain the strongest test design

17 of 30 scenarios target this repository itself. These consistently produce the richest analysis because:
- Ground truth is verifiable against disk
- Agents have genuine material to work with (299 skills, 62 agents, 12 teams)
- Findings are immediately actionable (orphan skills, CI improvements, coverage gaps)

### 2. Default skill composition is validated at all levels

- **Gardener** (#26, 25/25): meditate and heal invoked unprompted at correct procedural points
- **Alchemist** (#6, #30): meditate checkpoint between chrysopoeia and transmute catches bias
- **Meditate** (#18): standalone execution with genuine self-assessment
- **Tending team** (#5): all 4 members invoke contemplative practices naturally

### 3. Convergent findings across independent executions

Several findings emerged independently in multiple scenarios:
- **Orphan skills need host agents**: gardener (#26), entomology (#27), and original tending (#5) all flagged this
- **CI workflow improvements**: devops-engineer (#23), devops-platform (#20), and r-package-review (#22) all found the same action pinning issue
- **Ground truth estimation is unreliable**: Cartographer's Audit (#1) overestimated orphans; Conflicting Findings (#25) assumed nonexistent CVEs

### 4. Output scale correlates with team/composition level

| Configuration | Avg Output (chars) | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Skill (single) | ~15,000-34,000 | CAPA investigation: 33,862 |
| Agent (single) | ~15,000-25,000 | DevOps engineer: 15,952 |
| Team (multi-agent) | ~25,000-81,000 | Entomology: 81,076 |
| Multi-skill chain | ~24,000 | Alchemist chain: 24,109 |

### 5. Scope change handling is uniformly strong

28 of 30 scenarios included scope change triggers. All were absorbed gracefully. The strongest examples:
- Scrum team (#28): SM facilitates "does this align with Sprint Goal?" — textbook Scrum
- Gardener (#26): weeding assessment naturally integrated into the observation flow
- Entomology (#27): invasive species check produced concrete misclassified skill findings

## Perfect Scores

Three scenarios achieved 25/25 (100%):

| Scenario | Why Perfect |
|----------|-------------|
| #3 Metal Self-Extraction | 7 discrete procedure steps, each producing verifiable artifacts |
| #21 R Developer Package Audit | Flawless persona with :: qualified calls throughout; 6 skills referenced naturally |
| #26 Gardener Skill-in-Agent | Default skills internalized; sustained garden metaphor; zero vocabulary leakage |

The common thread: these agents had the deepest skill internalization — the methodology wasn't just followed, it was embodied.

## Coverage After Full Execution

| Dimension | Before (6 executed) | After (30 executed) | Gain |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|------|
| Coordination patterns | 4/7 (57%) | **7/7 (100%)** | +3 (parallel, wave-parallel, timeboxed) |
| Test levels | 3/5 (60%) | **5/5 (100%)** | +2 (negative, integration) |
| Teams tested | 4/12 (33%) | **8/12 (67%)** | +4 |
| Agents tested | 1/62 (2%) | **8/62 (13%)** | +7 |
| Skills tested | 1/299 (<1%) | **8/299 (3%)** | +7 |
| Negative tests | 0 | **5** | +5 |
| Integration tests | 0 | **3** | +3 |
| Total PASS rate | 6/6 (100%) | **29/30 (97%)** | More realistic |

## Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Cover all 7 coordination patterns | **DONE** |
| 2 | Add negative test scenarios | **DONE** (5 scenarios, 1 FAIL found) |
| 3 | Add integration tests | **DONE** (3 scenarios, all PASS) |
| 4 | Tag scenarios with duration tiers | **DONE** (quick/medium/long in registry) |
| 5 | Verify ground truth before committing scenarios | Partially done — F3 FAIL proves need |
| 6 | Implement `runs: N` for variance measurement | Not yet started |
| 7 | Test actual multi-agent execution | Not yet started |
| 8 | Create `create-test-scenario` skill | Proposed by alchemist chain (#30) |
| 9 | Add Handoff Quality Rubric for sequential tests | Proposed by alchemist chain (#30) |
| 10 | Redesign F3 scenario with verified conflict | Needed to close the 1 FAIL |

## Framework Maturity Assessment

The test framework has matured from "proof of concept" (6 scenarios, 4 patterns) to "operational" (30 scenarios, full coverage). The 97% pass rate is more informative than the original 100% — the 1 FAIL reveals a real quality issue (ground truth verification) that strengthens the framework.

The integration tests are the most important addition. They validate the system's core claim: that skills compose within agents, agents compose within teams, and multi-skill chains maintain context coherence. All three integration scenarios scored 96-100%, confirming that composition is the system's primary strength.

The next evolution is statistical: running scenarios multiple times to measure variance, not just pass/fail. The current 30 single-execution results establish baselines; repeat runs will establish confidence intervals.
