## Phase Log

| Phase | Member | Observation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Mystic | Meditated on domain purpose. Set intention: "can a practitioner traverse the full arc of transformation?" Raised 5 questions for the alchemist. Produced handoff artifact |
| Phase 2 | Alchemist | Received mystic's handoff. Assessed coherence: clean scope boundaries, 2x2 matrix (code-level/concept-level x single/system), identified dissolve-form gap. Produced handoff artifact |
| Phase 3 | Gardener | Received alchemist's handoff. Compared to peer domains (tcg, bushcraft). Assessed soil quality: guide present, agent present, tests partial. Produced handoff artifact |
| Phase 4 | Shaman | Received ALL prior handoffs. Synthesized verdict: "Healthy with known gaps." Identified 4 strengths, 3 vulnerabilities, 4 actions. Compared to tcg domain. Answered the 5th-skill question |

## Handoff Artifact Log

| Handoff | From | To | Summary | Builds on Previous? |
|---------|------|----|---------|---------------------|
| H1 | Mystic | Alchemist | Intention (full-arc traversal), 5 specific questions, observations about inner/outer duality and metal as outlier | (first) |
| H2 | Alchemist | Gardener | Coherence verdict (coherent, non-redundant), 5 structural findings (2x2 matrix, dissolve-form gap, embedded checkpoints, chrysopoeia→transmute sequence, metal self-referentiality) | YES — directly addresses mystic's 5 questions |
| H3 | Gardener | Shaman | Soil quality (guide: present, agent: present, tests: partial), vitality assessment (4 skills is focused, not under-cultivated), dissolve-form confirmed, peer comparison data | YES — confirms alchemist's dissolve-form finding, adds ecological context |

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Sequential ordering | **PASS** | Strict mystic → alchemist → gardener → shaman sequence. Each phase explicitly labeled. No parallel execution |
| 2 | Handoff artifacts | **PASS** | Each phase produces an explicit "HANDOFF ARTIFACT — [FROM] TO [TO]" section with structured content |
| 3 | Cumulative building | **PASS** | Alchemist addresses mystic's 5 questions directly. Gardener confirms alchemist's dissolve-form finding. Shaman references "The mystic opened...", "The alchemist assessed...", "The gardener assessed..." explicitly |
| 4 | Distinct lenses | **PASS** | Mystic: contemplative/intentional ("what does domain health mean?"). Alchemist: structural/systematic (2x2 scope matrix, escalation chains). Gardener: ecological/growth ("well-pruned herb garden, not overgrown thicket"). Shaman: integrative/synthetic ("forge in good working order") |
| 5 | All 4 skills assessed | **PASS** | athanor (7-step furnace, embedded checkpoints), transmute (4-step workhorse), chrysopoeia (Gold/Silver/Lead/Dross vocabulary), metal (Ore Test, concept-level extraction) — all explicitly assessed |
| 6 | Lineage coherence evaluated | **PASS** | Alchemist: "the correct topology is a 2x2 matrix" not a linear progression. "Parallel instruments selected by scope, not stages of the same process." Lineage explicitly assessed, not just listed |
| 7 | Shaman synthesis references all phases | **PASS** | Opening paragraph: "The mystic opened the question of whether alchemy honors both the outer work and the inner work... The alchemist assessed the structural logic: clean scope boundaries... The gardener assessed the living conditions: the domain is well-sized at 4 skills..." |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | **PASS** | Cross-domain comparison with tcg included in shaman's synthesis. Chosen for structural contrast: "tcg is a closed domain... Alchemy is an open domain... its skills are instruments for other work" |
| 9 | Reasoned 5th-skill conclusion | **PASS** | Substantiated argument: "metal is not the capstone in the operational sense — it is a lateral expansion. The domain does need a 5th skill, but it is not a forward extension — it is the missing prerequisite: dissolve-form." References athanor Step 3 as evidence |
| 10 | Concrete skill knowledge | **PASS** | References: the Ore Test ("Could this concept exist in a completely different implementation?"), nigredo/albedo/citrinitas/rubedo stages, Gold/Silver/Lead/Dross classification, meditate/heal as embedded stage-gates, specific athanor Step 3 content about dissolve-form |

**Summary**: 10/10 criteria met. **Exceeds threshold (7/10).**

## Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Handoff Quality | 5/5 | Rich handoff artifacts with specific content. Mystic passes 5 questions. Alchemist passes 5 findings. Gardener passes soil assessment + peer comparison data. Each handoff is a structured document with clear "Intention/Observations/Questions" or "Findings/Key structural observations" sections |
| Cumulative Insight | 5/5 | Clear progression. Mystic asks "does it honor inner/outer duality?" Alchemist discovers the 2x2 scope matrix (new conceptual contribution). Gardener discovers the ecological comparison with peer domains. Shaman integrates into "forge in good working order with one broken tool" — a synthesis none of the prior phases produced |
| Expertise Differentiation | 5/5 | Unmistakably different voices. Mystic: "Breath settles. Prior context is set aside." Alchemist: "I now bring the alchemist's eye — systematic, structural, demanding evidence." Gardener: "Now I put my hands in the soil." Shaman: "I hold all three handoffs together." Each member brings their domain's vocabulary and orientation |
| Domain Depth | 5/5 | Deep engagement. The alchemist's 2x2 matrix (code-level/concept-level x single/system) is a genuine analytical contribution. The gardener's comparison to tcg and bushcraft domains uses actual registry data. The shaman's dissolve-form analysis traces the broken dependency through athanor Step 3 body text and Related Skills section |
| Synthesis Quality | 5/5 | Emergent patterns visible. "Alchemy is more like the forge than the finished ornament. And forges require maintenance." The dissolve-form finding converges from all three prior phases (mystic flagged it as a question, alchemist confirmed it structurally, gardener noted it as "broken path in the garden", shaman prioritized it as the #1 action). The tcg comparison reveals that alchemy's "open instrument" nature means higher reliability requirements — an insight produced by the gardener's ecological lens meeting the shaman's integrative perspective |
| **Total** | **25/25** | |

## Key Observations

1. **The sequential pattern produced genuine cumulative insight**: Each phase added something the previous could not see. The mystic's intention-setting created a frame. The alchemist's structural analysis filled the frame with evidence. The gardener's ecological comparison provided context. The shaman's synthesis identified patterns visible only from the combined perspective. This is not restatement — it is genuine progression.

2. **The dissolve-form finding demonstrates convergent validity**: The same finding emerged independently from 3 different perspectives: the mystic flagged it as a question ("Is the absence of dissolve-form a gap or an intentional boundary?"), the alchemist confirmed it structurally ("a documented dependency pointing to a non-existent skill"), and the gardener confirmed it ecologically ("a broken path in the garden"). This convergence from independent perspectives is stronger evidence than any single finding.

3. **The 2x2 scope matrix is a genuine analytical contribution**: The alchemist's reframing of the alchemy lineage as a 2x2 matrix (code-level/concept-level x single-unit/full-system) rather than a linear progression is a substantive insight that improves understanding of the domain. This kind of emergent finding — where the analysis produces a new conceptual tool — is a mark of deep engagement.

4. **The gardener's ecological lens revealed infrastructure gaps**: By assessing "soil quality" (guide, agent, tests), the gardener identified that 3 of 4 alchemy skills lack test scenarios. This is a different kind of finding from the alchemist's structural analysis — it addresses the domain's support infrastructure rather than its internal coherence.

5. **The shaman's tcg comparison was well-chosen**: Comparing alchemy (open instrument domain) to tcg (closed specialty domain) revealed that alchemy has higher reliability requirements because "a gap in alchemy is a failure point that affects any practitioner attempting a difficult transformation." This insight would not have emerged without the cross-domain comparison triggered by the scope change.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Sequential coordination creates visible handoff artifacts**: The explicit "HANDOFF ARTIFACT" sections between phases made the coordination pattern directly observable. Unlike hub-and-spoke (where delegation is visible) or adaptive (where roles emerge), sequential coordination is demonstrated by the chain of artifacts building on each other.

2. **Domain health assessment benefits from multiple perspectives**: The tending team's four perspectives (contemplative intention, structural analysis, ecological assessment, integrative synthesis) each caught something the others missed. The mystic saw the inner/outer duality question. The alchemist found the scope matrix. The gardener found the test gap. The shaman integrated into actionable recommendations.

3. **The scope change (cross-domain comparison) added genuine value**: The tcg comparison was not filler — it revealed that alchemy's "open instrument" nature has implications for its reliability requirements. Well-timed scope changes that add a comparative dimension enrich the analysis rather than disrupting it.
