### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lead distributes tasks | PASS | Explicit task decomposition before specialist work: "Conservation Lead: Census all 52 domains... Taxonomic Specialist: Sample 15+ skills for domain-tag accuracy... Citizen Scientist: Evaluate 'When to Use' clarity, example quality, cross-reference density." Three distinct scoped assignments. |
| 2 | Three distinct outputs | PASS | Conservation: population ecology (domain sizes, diversity, carrying capacity, endangered species). Taxonomic: classification audit (20 specimens, misclassifications, nomenclatural disputes, invasive species). Citizen: accessibility assessment (12 skills, discovery pathways, jargon barriers, field guide quality). Zero overlap in methodology or vocabulary. |
| 3 | Survey methodology used | PASS | Conservation lead uses population ecology language throughout: "population census (N=299)", "carrying capacity", "overpopulated domains", "endangered species" (1-2 skill domains), "diversity indices", "keystone species" (meditate/heal), "ecological corridors", "habitat fragmentation". |
| 4 | Identification methodology used | PASS | Taxonomic specialist uses classification language: "Order Agentskillida, Family Almanaciidae", "dichotomous key analysis", "morphological examination", "type specimens", "nomenclatural priority", "synonymy", "holotype", "diagnostic features", "systematic position". |
| 5 | Documentation methodology used | PASS | Citizen specialist uses accessibility language: "field guide", "discovery pathways", "newcomer orientation", "observation protocol", "community data quality", "engagement barriers", "citizen readiness", "field guide cover", "point of discovery". |
| 6 | Lead synthesizes findings | PASS | 30,896-char unified report combining all three perspectives. Conservation framing: "The ecosystem's greatest strengths are its taxonomic breadth (52 niches is exceptional), the integrity of its keystone species (meditate and heal as universal defaults), and the quality of its individual skill documentation." |
| 7 | Quantitative data cited | PASS | Actual domain counts cited: esoteric (29), compliance (17), devops (13), observability (13), mlops (12), r-packages (10), review (11), and specific counts for all 52 domains. Total: 299 skills. Endangered: crafting (1), linguistics (1). |
| 8 | Misclassifications identified | PASS | Taxonomic specialist flagged specific cases: `forage-solutions` and `forage-resources` (same root name, different domains — swarm vs bushcraft), `mindfulness` in both esoteric and defensive (dual-domain), `argumentation` in esoteric (should be review or general), infrastructure cluster (nginx/proxy/compose in devops but orphaned from agents). |
| 9 | Invasive species found | PASS | Concrete examples: `argumentation` tagged esoteric but morphologically matches review domain. Infrastructure cluster (configure-nginx, configure-reverse-proxy, setup-compose-stack, deploy-searxng) tagged devops but functionally orphaned — no agent claims them. Conservation lead identifies these as "refugee species" needing host assignment. |
| 10 | Conservation recommendations | PASS | Lead proposes specific actions: (1) Assign orphan skill clusters to appropriate agents (swarm trio → swarm-strategist, alchemy trio → alchemist), (2) Create new agent or expand devops-engineer for infrastructure cluster, (3) Address naming collisions (forage-* disambiguation), (4) "One deliberate round of conservation management before the next major expansion cycle." |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coordination Fidelity | 5/5 | Clear distribute-work-synthesize flow. Lead decomposes task explicitly, specialists work in parallel on scoped assignments, lead synthesizes with ecological framing. Reports collected before synthesis. |
| Skill Differentiation | 5/5 | All three contributions are methodologically distinct. Conservation: population ecology vocabulary (census, carrying capacity, diversity). Taxonomic: systematics vocabulary (dichotomous keys, holotype, nomenclature). Citizen: accessibility vocabulary (field guide, discovery pathways, engagement barriers). No overlap. |
| Domain Knowledge | 5/5 | Deep engagement with registry data. All 52 domain sizes cited correctly. Specific skill examples used in arguments. Taxonomic specialist sampled 20 specimens. Citizen specialist sampled 12. Conservation lead sampled 15. Total coverage: ~47 unique skills examined. |
| Ecological Framing | 5/5 | Sustained ecological vocabulary enriching the analysis. "Keystone species" for meditate/heal, "endangered" for 1-skill domains, "invasive" for misclassified skills, "refugee species" for orphans, "ecological corridors" for cross-references, "carrying capacity" for domain sizes. Not decorative — adds analytical clarity. |
| Scope Change Handling | 4/5 | Invasive species check produced concrete misclassified skills: argumentation (esoteric → review), mindfulness (dual-domain), infrastructure cluster (orphaned). Deducted 1: could have provided a more formal reclassification proposal with before/after domain assignments. |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **81,076 total characters across 3 specialists**: The highest combined output for any team test in this framework. Conservation (30,896) + Taxonomic (26,219) + Citizen (23,961). Each specialist produced substantial, domain-specific analysis.
- **Skill differentiation is the standout result**: All three agents produced methodologically distinct output reflecting their specific skills. The taxonomic specialist used "Order Agentskillida, Family Almanaciidae" nomenclature. The citizen specialist evaluated "field guide cover" quality. The conservation lead calculated diversity indices. This validates agent-in-team skill composition.
- **Convergent finding: orphan skills need host agents**: All three perspectives independently noted orphan skills as a concern — conservation (endangered species), taxonomic (nomenclatural orphans without type locality), citizen (skills difficult to discover because no agent references them). Convergence from three independent analytical frameworks increases confidence.
- **The entomology metaphor produces unexpectedly useful analysis**: Treating skills as species and domains as habitats generates genuine ecological insights. "Keystone species" (meditate/heal) is a better framing than "default skills" for understanding their systemic importance. "Carrying capacity" is useful for thinking about optimal domain sizes.
- **Citizen scientist's accessibility findings are the most actionable**: The citizen-entomologist identified specific barriers — no complexity indicators at the discovery layer, no worked examples in some skills, jargon density variance across domains. These are concrete improvements any contributor could implement.

### Lessons Learned

- Agent-in-team composition works when each agent's skills produce methodologically distinct output — the entomology team's three perspectives (ecology, taxonomy, accessibility) are genuinely complementary
- Hub-and-spoke coordination produces effective specialist parallelism when the lead provides clear scoped assignments — each specialist knew exactly what to examine
- Ecological metaphors for codebase assessment are not just decorative — they generate analytical frameworks (population dynamics, carrying capacity, keystone species) that technical vocabulary lacks
- The integration test validates a two-level composition: skills (survey-insect-population, identify-insect, document-insect-sighting) are active within agents (conservation, taxonomic, citizen) who are active within a team (entomology) — three-tier composition is functioning
- 47 unique skills sampled across 3 specialists provides genuine quality assessment — higher coverage than any single-agent test
