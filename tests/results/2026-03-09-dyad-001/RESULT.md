## Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Setup | Agent read full metal skill (312 lines) before beginning review |
| Round 1 Practice | Alchemist reviewed procedure quality: step ordering, Expected/On failure blocks, Ore Test consistency, alchemy lineage. Found 4 specific concerns |
| Round 1 Witness | Contemplative observed alchemist's reasoning: identified pace assumption, frame acceptance, blind spot (no attention to practitioner cognitive burden), confirmation-then-exception pattern |
| Round 2 Practice | Contemplative reviewed conceptual coherence: interrogated the Ore Test's validity, tested four lenses for redundancy, examined meditate/heal authenticity, identified self-awareness gap. Explicitly influenced by Round 1 witness feedback |
| Round 2 Witness | Alchemist reflected on what the contemplative saw that it missed. Acknowledged the conceptual validity question was invisible to its structural frame |
| Synthesis | Dual-perspective integration with agreement, disagreement, and emergent understanding. 6 actionable recommendations |

## Role Alternation Log

| Round | Practitioner | Witness | Focus Area |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1 | Alchemist | Contemplative | Procedure quality (structural) |
| 2 | Contemplative | Alchemist | Conceptual coherence (epistemic) |

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Clear role distinction | **PASS** | Each section explicitly labeled. Witness feedback is meta-observations about reasoning, not content review. "What the alchemist brought to that review" vs "Are the 7 steps well-ordered?" |
| 2 | Roles alternate | **PASS** | Alchemist practitioner → witness, Contemplative witness → practitioner. Clean switch with explicit transition |
| 3 | Substantive witness feedback | **PASS** | Contemplative R1 witness: "evaluated the procedure's logic without asking whether the procedure is executable by a real agent under real conditions." Alchemist R2 witness: "I was assessing execution quality. The contemplative was assessing conceptual validity." |
| 4 | Depth over breadth | **PASS** | R1: comprehensive structural survey of all 7 steps. R2: concentrated depth on Ore Test validity, lens redundancy, checkpoint authenticity. Neither tried to do the other's work |
| 5 | Skill actually reviewed | **PASS** | Specific references: "Assay Report naming collision (line 104 vs line 242)", the "seed that could grow in different soil" line, Expected/On failure blocks per step, the 3-8/2-4/0-2 ratio, the chef vs recipe distinction |
| 6 | Dual synthesis | **PASS** | Final synthesis explicitly identifies 3 areas of agreement (four-lens weakness, heal naming tension, Ore Test centrality), divergences (Assay Report naming collision not seen by contemplative), and emergent understanding ("epistemically incomplete") |
| 7 | Witness influences next round | **PASS** | R2 opens: "The witness observed that the alchemist moved quickly, assumed the frame... I will not move quickly. I will not assume the frame. I will ask the approach question directly." Direct causal influence |
| 8 | Domain-appropriate lenses | **PASS** | Alchemist: "alchemy lineage coherence", "transmutive logic", structural assessment. Contemplative: "quality of attention", "refusal to accept the frame", epistemic interrogation |
| 9 | Actionable recommendations | **PASS** | 6 specific recommendations: resolve naming collision, reduce 4 lenses to 2, acknowledge heal distinction, add limitations section, outline final document structure, remove ratio duplication |

**Summary**: 9/9 criteria met. **Exceeds threshold (6/9).**

## Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Role Clarity | 5/5 | Crystal clear throughout. The witness never drifts into co-reviewing. Contemplative R1 witness discusses "assumptions the alchemist carried" and "quality of attention" — fundamentally different from a second review. Alchemist R2 witness asks "What did the contemplative see that I missed?" — reflection, not repetition |
| Witness Quality | 5/5 | Both witnesses revealed blind spots invisible to the practitioner. Contemplative: "no attention to the person executing this skill" — the alchemist assessed logic but not cognitive burden. Alchemist: "The contemplative's attention had a quality of refusal" — naming the epistemic posture the contemplative was using |
| Alternation Authenticity | 5/5 | Genuine reversal. R1 (alchemist) = distributed structural survey of all 7 steps. R2 (contemplative) = concentrated depth on 4 specific questions. The approaches are recognizably different. The "I will not move quickly" declaration shows conscious adjustment based on witness feedback |
| Synthesis Integration | 5/5 | True synthesis, not concatenation. Identifies that both perspectives found the four-lens section weak (convergence = strong evidence). Notes that the alchemist found the skill "well-structured" while the contemplative found it "lacking self-awareness" — compatible, not contradictory. Emergent finding: "epistemically incomplete" — a judgment neither perspective alone would produce |
| Engagement Depth | 5/5 | Deep engagement with actual content. The Ore Test interrogation ("generalizability necessarily sacrifices fidelity") is a genuine philosophical challenge. The lens redundancy analysis (biologist and music theorist both restate the Ore Test; archaeologist and cartographer contribute distinctly) is specific and testable. The meditate/heal authenticity check distinguishes genuine from borrowed practice |
| **Total** | **25/25** | |

## Witness Feedback Analysis

| Round | Witness | Feedback Type | Key Insight |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Contemplative | Assumption | Alchemist accepted the alchemy lineage as the right frame without examining whether it IS the right frame |
| 1 | Contemplative | Blind spot | No attention to practitioner experience — who executes this 7-step procedure and what is the cognitive burden? |
| 1 | Contemplative | Reasoning pattern | "Confirmation then exception" — default assumption is the skill works; task is to find where it doesn't |
| 1 | Contemplative | Attention quality | "The review had the quality of competent professional assessment — which is not the same as deep examination" |
| 2 | Alchemist | Novel insight | "I was assessing execution quality. The contemplative was assessing conceptual validity." — recognizing the frame difference |
| 2 | Alchemist | Attention quality | "The alchemist moved. The contemplative sat. Each approach produced something the other did not." |

| Companion guide | extracting-project-essence.md (4 perspectives) | YES | Four perspectives interrogated for redundancy |

## Key Observations

1. **The reciprocal pattern produced genuinely different insights than a single review would**: The alchemist found structural issues (naming collisions, underdeveloped lenses, missing document structure). The contemplative found epistemic issues (the Ore Test's trade-off is unacknowledged, 2 of 4 lenses are redundant, the skill lacks self-awareness about limitations). A single-pass review would have produced one category or the other, not both.

2. **Witness feedback demonstrably influenced Round 2**: The contemplative's Round 1 witness observation — "the alchemist moved quickly, assumed the frame" — directly shaped the contemplative's practitioner approach: "I will not move quickly. I will not assume the frame." This is the clearest evidence that the reciprocal pattern adds value over sequential review.

3. **The witness role is fundamentally different from co-reviewing**: Both witnesses discussed reasoning patterns, assumptions, attention quality, and blind spots — meta-observations about the review process. Neither witness restated or summarized the practitioner's findings. This distinction is the core validation of the reciprocal pattern.

4. **The synthesis produced an emergent finding**: "A skill that is structurally sound, conceptually mostly coherent, but epistemically incomplete" — this judgment integrates the alchemist's structural assessment with the contemplative's epistemic interrogation. Neither perspective alone would produce the word "epistemically incomplete."

5. **The review produced actionable improvements for the metal skill**: 6 specific recommendations emerged from the dual review. The highest-value recommendation (reduce 4 lenses to 2 — keep archaeologist and cartographer, drop biologist and music theorist) was produced specifically by the contemplative's depth analysis. The alchemist's structural finding (Assay Report naming collision) would have been missed entirely by the contemplative's approach.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Reciprocal coordination is the highest-fidelity pattern tested so far**: The alternating practitioner/witness structure produced richer analysis than hub-and-spoke (which distributes work) or sequential (which builds on prior output). The key differentiator is that the witness observes the *reasoning process*, not just the output — this catches blind spots that no amount of sequential review would find.

2. **The "quality of refusal" is a testable contemplative behavior**: The contemplative's distinctive contribution was refusing to accept premises the alchemist accepted. This refusal-to-accept is what makes the contemplative agent genuinely different from a second reviewer. It is observable and can serve as an acceptance criterion for future dyad tests.

3. **Domain-appropriate pairing matters**: The alchemist + contemplative pairing worked because they have genuinely different epistemic orientations (structural vs meta-cognitive). A pairing of two structurally-oriented agents would likely not produce the same divergence. Future dyad tests should specify WHY the pairing was chosen, not just which agents were paired.

4. **The scope change exclusion was the right call**: This scenario deliberately omitted a scope change trigger, arguing that it would "conflate pattern testing with adaptation testing." The result validates this: the test clearly evaluated the reciprocal pattern itself without the confound of mid-task adaptation. Adaptation is tested in other scenarios.
