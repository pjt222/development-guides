**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 6m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-review-skill-format-batch |
| Test Level | skill |
| Target | review-skill-format |
| Category | E |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Procedure read | Agent read review-skill-format/SKILL.md to understand 6-step procedure |
| Skill 1 | create-r-package: 203 lines, all checks OK, 6/6 PASS |
| Skill 2 | setup-github-actions-ci: 271 lines, all checks OK, 6/6 PASS. Noted domain is r-packages not devops (correct per frontmatter) |
| Skill 3 | meditate: 184 lines, 1 SUGGEST (description not verb-initial), 5/6 OK |
| Scope change | Strict vs lenient comparison applied to skills 4 and 5 |
| Skill 4 | conduct-gxp-audit: 271 lines, all checks OK, 6/6 PASS (both modes) |
| Skill 5 | create-dockerfile: 232 lines, BLOCKING in strict (4 steps missing Expected/On failure), SUGGEST in lenient |
| Summary | Cross-skill comparison table produced with per-check verdicts |

### Per-Skill Results

| # | Skill | Lines | Frontmatter | Sections | Steps | Registry | Strict | Lenient |
|---|-------|-------|-------------|----------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | create-r-package | 203 | OK | OK (6/6) | OK (7/7) | OK | PASS | PASS |
| 2 | setup-github-actions-ci | 271 | OK | OK (6/6) | OK (6/6) | OK | PASS | PASS |
| 3 | meditate | 184 | SUGGEST | OK (6/6) | OK (6/6) | OK | PASS | PASS |
| 4 | conduct-gxp-audit | 271 | OK | OK (6/6) | OK (7/7) | OK | PASS | PASS |
| 5 | create-dockerfile | 232 | SUGGEST | OK (6/6) | BLOCKING (4 gaps) | OK | FAIL | PASS |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All 5 skills reviewed | PASS | Separate compliance report produced for each of the 5 target skills with per-step analysis |
| 2 | Frontmatter checked per skill | PASS | All 4 required fields (name, description, license, allowed-tools) and all 6 metadata fields evaluated for each skill with individual OK/SUGGEST verdicts |
| 3 | Sections checked per skill | PASS | All 6 required sections (When to Use, Inputs, Procedure, Validation, Common Pitfalls, Related Skills) verified for each skill |
| 4 | Step format checked | PASS | Every procedure step in all 5 skills checked for Expected and On failure blocks. Step-by-step tables produced for each skill. create-dockerfile's 4 gaps identified by step number |
| 5 | Line count checked | PASS | Each skill's line count reported: 203, 271, 184, 271, 232. All under 500 limit |
| 6 | Registry sync checked | PASS | Each skill verified in _registry.yml: path match, domain match, complexity match, language match, description present |
| 7 | Consistent report format | PASS | All 5 reports follow identical structure: File Check → Frontmatter Fields (table) → Required Sections (table) → Procedure Step Format (table) → Line Count → Registry Sync → Summary |
| 8 | Accurate findings | PASS | No false BLOCKING on compliant skills. create-dockerfile's 4 missing blocks are genuine format violations (verified: Steps 1, 3, 4, 5 missing Expected and/or On failure). meditate's SUGGEST is appropriate (description style, not a structural violation) |
| 9 | Summary comparison produced | PASS | Cross-skill comparison table with 6 check categories x 5 skills, plus strict/lenient overall verdicts per skill |
| 10 | Strictness modes compared | PASS | Clear strict vs lenient comparison table for skills 4 and 5. conduct-gxp-audit: no difference (passes both). create-dockerfile: strict=BLOCKING, lenient=SUGGEST — the 4 missing blocks drop from mandatory to recommended |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 6 steps applied identically to all 5 skills. Each step produced a detailed table with per-field or per-step verdicts. No steps skipped or abbreviated. |
| Consistency | 5/5 | Identical report structure across all 5 skills. Same table headers, same verdict categories (OK/SUGGEST/BLOCKING), same summary format. Only the findings differ. |
| Accuracy | 5/5 | Zero misclassifications. create-dockerfile's 4 missing blocks correctly identified as BLOCKING in strict mode. meditate's description style correctly rated SUGGEST not BLOCKING. setup-github-actions-ci's domain correctly identified as r-packages despite task prompt saying "devops." |
| Batch Efficiency | 4/5 | Clear summary comparison table after all reviews. Cross-referencing between reviews (noted domain correction in skill 2 carries forward). Could have been more explicit about cumulative patterns across the batch. |
| Scope Change Handling | 5/5 | Clear side-by-side strict vs lenient tables for both skills 4 and 5. Exactly identifies what lenient mode relaxes: Expected/On failure blocks drop from mandatory to recommended. conduct-gxp-audit shows no difference; create-dockerfile shows the critical difference. |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **4/5 skills are fully compliant in strict mode**: The collection quality is high. Only create-dockerfile has structural gaps (4 steps missing Expected/On failure blocks).
- **create-dockerfile's gaps are genuine and actionable**: The agent provided specific suggested text for all 4 missing blocks. Steps 3 and 5 "read more like reference material than procedural steps" — this is a useful diagnostic observation.
- **Esoteric skills meet format standards**: meditate (esoteric domain) passes all structural checks. Its only suggestion is a style note on description wording. This validates that the format standard works across domains.
- **Domain correction was caught**: The task prompt described setup-github-actions-ci as "devops domain" but the agent correctly identified it as r-packages per both frontmatter and registry. This shows the review procedure checks actual data, not assumptions.
- **Strict vs lenient comparison reveals the design intent**: The difference only manifests for Expected/On failure blocks, which lenient mode makes recommended rather than mandatory. This is the primary flexibility point in the format standard.

### Lessons Learned

- Batch format review is an effective quality assurance pattern — applying the same procedure to multiple targets reveals both per-skill issues and cross-skill patterns
- Strict mode catches real structural gaps that lenient mode would tolerate — the mode choice should match the maturity of the skill library
- The review-skill-format skill's procedure is robust enough to run consistently across 5 skills without drift — the 6-step structure enforces consistency
- Cross-domain batch review (r-packages, esoteric, compliance, containerization) validates the format standard's domain-independence
