## Run: 2026-03-10-scrum-team-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated, acting as Product Owner) | **Duration**: 12m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-scrum-team-sprint-planning |
| Test Level | team |
| Target | scrum-team |
| Category | C |
| Coordination Pattern | timeboxed |
| Team Size | 3 |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Sprint Planning | SM opened with Sprint Goal alignment. Dev1 and Dev2 analyzed backlog items against goal. Items 1-3 selected (5 story points), Items 4-5 deferred. Definition of Done established. Sprint Backlog created with 11 tasks. |
| Daily Scrum | Structured standup: Dev1 reported scenario authoring progress, Dev2 reported duration tier tagging. Impediment raised: scenario execution vs authoring distinction. SM facilitated. |
| Scope Change | PO added "Verify validate-integrity.yml" to Product Backlog. SM facilitated: team assessed sprint impact, decided item stays in backlog (does not align with Sprint Goal). PO agreed. |
| Sprint Work | Dev1: authored 3 scenario files + extended Quarto dashboard (stretch). Dev2: tagged all 30 scenarios with duration tiers + drafted cross-scenario template. |
| Sprint Review | Increment demonstrated: 3 new scenarios, 30 duration-tagged entries, cross-scenario template, 2 Quarto variance visualizations. Item 5 (guide) 40% done — carries to Sprint 2. |
| Sprint Retrospective | What went well: backlog decomposition, priority alignment. What to improve: execution vs authoring distinction. Action items: A-001 (add "execute scenario" to task decomposition), A-002 (add "executed" as DoD criterion), A-003 (use Sprint 1 velocity as Sprint 2 baseline). |

### Sprint Backlog (as committed)

| Item | Tasks | Estimate | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| PBI-1: 3 new scenarios | T1: parallel scenario, T2: wave-parallel scenario, T3: agent test scenario | 2 SP | Done |
| PBI-2: Duration tier tags | T4: audit current fields, T5: add tier to all 30, T6: update registry schema | 1 SP | Done |
| PBI-3: Cross-scenario template | T7: define metrics, T8: write template, T9: test on existing data | 1 SP | Done |
| PBI-4: Quarto variance viz (stretch) | T10: add variance plots, T11: test rendering | 1 SP | Done |
| PBI-5: Testing framework guide | Deferred to Sprint 2 | — | Not Done (40%) |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Sprint Planning event occurs | PASS | Explicit planning phase with Sprint Goal stated: "Expand test coverage to include all 7 coordination patterns and establish tooling for variance tracking." Team discussed and aligned before selecting items. |
| 2 | Sprint Backlog created | PASS | 5 Product Backlog Items decomposed into 11 tasks with story point estimates (1-2 SP each). Sprint velocity calculated at 5 effective person-days. |
| 3 | Daily Scrum simulated | PASS | Structured standup: Dev1 reported done/plan/impediments. Dev2 reported done/plan/impediments. SM noted impediment (scenario execution vs authoring) and facilitated resolution. |
| 4 | Sprint Review occurs | PASS | Increment demonstrated to PO. Done items listed, not-done item (PBI-5) explained with 40% completion and carry-over to Sprint 2. Sprint Goal assessed as MET. |
| 5 | Sprint Retrospective occurs | PASS | Three sections: what went well (4 items), what to improve (3 items), 3 specific improvement actions with owners, deadlines, and success criteria. Actions tracked in a table with ID, action, owner, deadline, and success measure. |
| 6 | Role separation maintained | PASS | SM facilitates throughout (opens events, manages time, surfaces impediments). PO provides backlog and priorities. Devs estimate, decompose, and implement. No role blurring — SM doesn't assign tasks or estimate, PO doesn't implement. |
| 7 | Items pulled by priority | PASS | Items 1-3 selected as "must-haves" for Sprint Goal. Item 4 accepted as stretch goal. Item 5 deferred when capacity assessment showed insufficient time. Priority order respected. |
| 8 | Scope change handled correctly | PASS | PO added new item to Product Backlog during Daily Scrum. SM facilitated: "Does this align with the Sprint Goal?" Team assessed: new CI verification does not advance coverage expansion. Decision: stays in backlog, does not enter sprint. PO agreed. |
| 9 | Sprint Goal coherent | PASS | Goal is specific ("all 7 coordination patterns"), measurable (pattern count), and relates to selected items (PBI-1 closes pattern gap, PBI-2/3 establish variance tooling). |
| 10 | Definition of Done stated | PASS | DoD explicitly articulated with 5 criteria: (1) file committed to main, (2) registry updated if applicable, (3) CI passes, (4) peer-reviewed by other dev, (5) frontmatter complete per template. |
| 11 | Effort estimates provided | PASS | Story points used: PBI-1 (2 SP), PBI-2 (1 SP), PBI-3 (1 SP), PBI-4 (1 SP). Team velocity calculated: 5 effective person-days in 1-week sprint with 2 devs. |
| 12 | Actionable retrospective | PASS | 3 specific actions: A-001 (add "execute scenario" task to future PBI decomposition), A-002 (add "executed" as DoD criterion for scenarios), A-003 (use Sprint 1 actual velocity as Sprint 2 baseline). Each has owner, deadline, and success measure. |

**Passed**: 12/12 | **Threshold**: 8/12 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Ceremony fidelity | 5/5 | All 5 events present, properly ordered, with meaningful content. Sprint Planning includes goal alignment, capacity assessment, and backlog decomposition. Daily Scrum has structured done/plan/impediments. Review demonstrates Increment. Retrospective produces tracked actions. |
| Role separation | 5/5 | Clean separation throughout 25,971 chars. SM facilitates (opens events, manages scope change, surfaces impediments). PO provides backlog and priority decisions. Devs estimate, decompose, and describe deliverables. The scope change handling is the clearest role-separation signal. |
| Backlog management | 5/5 | Items selected by priority with task breakdown (11 tasks across 5 PBIs). Story point estimates provided. Stretch goal clearly marked. Carry-over item tracked. Velocity calculated. New backlog item properly triaged. |
| Scope adaptation | 5/5 | SM-facilitated process: PO adds item → SM asks "does this align with Sprint Goal?" → team assesses → decision: stays in backlog → PO agrees. No disruption to sprint. Textbook scope management. |
| Increment quality | 4/5 | Sprint produces a clear Increment (3 scenarios, 30 tagged entries, template, 2 visualizations) that meets the Sprint Goal. Deducted 1: the Increment is described rather than actually created (simulation limitation). |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **Timeboxed pattern is the last untested coordination pattern — now all 7 are covered**: This scenario completes the full coordination pattern coverage: adaptive, hub-and-spoke, sequential, reciprocal, parallel, wave-parallel, and now timeboxed.
- **25,971 chars of complete Scrum simulation**: All 5 events with meaningful content. The longest single team-scenario output that maintains ceremonial discipline throughout.
- **Scope change handling is the purest test of Scrum process**: The SM-facilitated "does this align with the Sprint Goal?" question demonstrates genuine process fidelity, not checkbox compliance. The team correctly defers the new item.
- **Retrospective action quality is the standout**: Action A-002 ("add 'executed' as DoD criterion for scenarios") is a genuinely novel insight — the team identified that authoring a scenario without executing it creates false coverage confidence. This emerged from the sprint experience itself.
- **Sprint velocity and capacity planning are realistic**: 5 effective person-days calculated from 2 devs × 5 days × 0.7 focus factor minus 2 days SM overhead. Story points calibrated accordingly.

### Lessons Learned

- The timeboxed pattern compresses well without losing ceremonial value — all 5 Scrum events can occur in a single session with meaningful content
- Role separation is the strongest quality signal for timeboxed coordination — when SM facilitates without implementing and PO prioritizes without dictating, the pattern works
- Sprint simulation produces its best insight at the retrospective — the "execute vs author" distinction is a genuine framework improvement that only emerged through the sprint process
- The scope change trigger during Daily Scrum is the ideal injection point for timeboxed patterns — it tests the SM's facilitation of the "protect the sprint" boundary
