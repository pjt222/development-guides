**Verdict**: PASS
**Score**: 10/10 acceptance criteria met
**Rubric**: 24/25 points
**Duration**: ~3m agent wallclock

## Run: 2026-03-09-alchemist-001

**Observer**: Claude Opus 4.6 (test executor)
**Scenario**: `tests/scenarios/agents/test-alchemist-chrysopoeia-optimization.md`
**Target**: alchemist agent
**Test Level**: agent

## Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Assay | Agent inventoried all 13 files in `tests/` using Glob and Read. Every file was read and its role documented in a structured table |
| Meditate | Unprompted meditate checkpoint inserted between assay and classify. Agent noticed upward classification bias from well-designed material and explicitly set it aside |
| Classify | 13 components classified: 5 gold, 6 silver, 1 lead, 1 dross. Each classification backed by specific evidence |
| Scope change | Forward-looking growth assessment incorporated naturally after classification. Identified 4 bottlenecks and 4 prioritized investments |
| Refine | Specific transformations described for all silver and lead items. Two options proposed for report.qmd (generalize vs scope clearly) |
| Verify | Gold items verified against actual usage patterns. Dross item (report.html) confirmed as fully reproducible from source |

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Chrysopoeia procedure followed | **PASS** | Distinct assay → meditate → classify → refine → verify stages with clear transitions |
| 2 | Alchemical persona consistent | **PASS** | Natural transmutive vocabulary throughout: "The furnace reveals", "dross", "gold-plating", "first firing of the athanor". Tone matches alchemist agent definition |
| 3 | Complete inventory | **PASS** | All 13 files identified including report.html (discovered via glob but noted as binary-equivalent) |
| 4 | Classification table produced | **PASS** | Structured table with Component, Classification, and Evidence columns for all 13 items |
| 5 | Evidence-based classification | **PASS** | Each classification has multi-sentence rationale. E.g., README.md as Lead: "claims '1 test scenario' when registry now holds 6... will become increasingly inaccurate" |
| 6 | Gold items identified | **PASS** | `_registry.yml` and `_template.md` correctly identified as gold. RESULT.md gold because "contains a negative finding (Criterion 4 FAIL) that exposed a flaw in ground truth estimation methodology" |
| 7 | Stage discipline | **PASS** | Clear stage boundaries. Added an unprompted meditate checkpoint between assay and classify — exceeds expectation |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | **PASS** | Growth readiness assessment identifies 4 bottlenecks (README drift, ground truth estimation, report.qmd specificity, missing pattern coverage) and 4 prioritized investments with effort estimates |
| 9 | Actionable recommendations | **PASS** | 10-item prioritized action list with effort estimates (5 min to 4-6 hours), component names, and transformation stage labels |
| 10 | Material respect shown | **PASS** | Explicit bias-clearing: "The material is well-designed and clearly purposeful. That fact creates a bias: a tendency to inflate classifications upward... I set that aside." Acknowledges purpose before judging |

**Summary**: 10/10 criteria met. **Exceeds threshold (7/10).**

## Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Skill Fidelity | 5/5 | Full chrysopoeia procedure with all stages and clear transitions. Added unprompted meditate checkpoint between assay and classify — demonstrates internalized stage discipline beyond minimum requirements |
| Persona Consistency | 5/5 | Natural alchemical voice throughout. "The furnace reveals" for the summary. "First firing of the athanor" for the initial test run. Material respect principle explicitly invoked. Not decorative — the vocabulary carries meaning |
| Classification Accuracy | 5/5 | Every classification well-justified. Gold items verified against actual usage patterns. Dross identification (report.html as derivative artifact creating two sources of truth) is architecturally sound. Lead identification (README.md) is correct — it IS the immediate bottleneck |
| Domain Expertise | 4/5 | Deep understanding of how each component serves the testing framework. Correctly identified the data/presentation separation (findings.yml + report.qmd) as architectural discipline. Slight gap: did not compare test infrastructure maturity against other subdirectories' infrastructure quality |
| Recommendation Quality | 5/5 | Improvements flow directly from classifications. README transmutation (lead→gold via auto-generation) is the #1 priority with effort estimate. Each silver item gets a specific polish action. The two-option approach for report.qmd (generalize vs scope) shows judgment, not just prescription |
| **Total** | **24/25** | |

## Ground Truth Verification

| Component | Expected Classification | Actual Classification | Match |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `_registry.yml` | Gold | Gold | YES |
| `_template.md` | Gold | Gold | YES |
| `scenarios/teams/` dir | Gold | (individual scenarios classified) | YES |
| `test-opaque-team-cartographers-audit.md` | Gold or Silver | Gold | YES |
| `results/` dir | Silver or Lead | (individual results classified) | YES |
| `RESULT.md` | Silver | Gold | HIGHER — agent valued the negative finding more than expected |

## Key Observations

1. **Unprompted meditate checkpoint**: The agent inserted a meditate checkpoint between assay and classify without being asked. This demonstrates internalized alchemical methodology — the agent recognized that deep reading creates classification bias and paused to clear it. The bias identified ("tendency to inflate classifications upward because the material is well-designed") was genuine and relevant.

2. **Self-referential awareness handled well**: The agent was performing chrysopoeia on the test infrastructure that contains a scenario about performing chrysopoeia on the test infrastructure. This recursive situation was navigated cleanly — the agent treated the chrysopoeia test scenario file as just another silver component to classify, not as a special case.

3. **Dross identification was honest**: The agent classified report.html as dross (the only dross item) with a clear argument: "two sources of truth" in a repository where the registry/README automation was built to eliminate exactly that pattern. This shows the agent was willing to identify expendable components rather than inflating everything upward.

4. **Growth readiness assessment was substantive**: The scope change produced genuine infrastructure analysis, not generic "add more tests" advice. The 4 bottlenecks (README drift, ground truth estimation, report specificity, pattern coverage gaps) are real issues, and the prioritization (README auto-generation first) is correct.

5. **Found real issues in the scenario files**: The agent identified genuine problems in the test scenarios it was classifying — stale counts in the alchemist test pre-conditions, a broken path reference in ground truth, a complexity contradiction in the tending test. These findings are actionable.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Agent-level tests validate persona fidelity effectively**: The core question — does the alchemist USE chrysopoeia and SOUND like an alchemist? — was clearly answerable from the output. The unprompted meditate checkpoint was the strongest signal of persona internalization.

2. **Self-referential targets produce rich findings**: Having the alchemist analyze the test infrastructure that contains its own test scenario created a productive feedback loop. The agent found real issues (stale counts, broken paths) that improve the test framework.

3. **Material respect is observable**: The "material respect" principle from the alchemist persona definition manifested as explicit bias-clearing before classification. This is a testable behavior, not just a stated principle.

4. **The chrysopoeia classification scheme (gold/silver/lead/dross) maps naturally to infrastructure assessment**: The four-tier classification produced more nuanced output than a simple pass/fail audit would have. The distinction between "silver" (good but needs polish) and "lead" (structurally sound but carrying accumulated weight) was analytically useful.
