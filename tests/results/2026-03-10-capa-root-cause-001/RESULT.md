| Scenario ID | test-investigate-capa-root-cause |
| Test Level | skill |
| Target | investigate-capa-root-cause |
| Category | E |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Skill read | Read investigate-capa-root-cause SKILL.md (6-step procedure with initiate, select method, analyse, design CAPA, verify, trend) |
| Evidence gathering | Read cross-scenario analysis, opaque-team RESULT.md, tending RESULT.md, dyad RESULT.md, alignment RESULT.md, opaque-team scenario file, opaque-team team definition |
| Initiate | Created investigation document RCA-CAPA-2026-001 with blame-free problem statement, Major severity, trigger event |
| Method selection | Selected 5-Why + fishbone combination with explicit justification: multi-factor problem needs both linear and categorical analysis |
| 5-Why analysis | 5 levels deep with evidence citations at each level: symptom → operational cause → scenario design → pattern design → measurement design |
| Fishbone analysis | All 6 categories (People, Process, Technology, Materials, Environment, Measurement) examined with confirmed/denied causes per category |
| Scope change | Framework limitation (single-agent simulation) assessed as confounding variable, not root cause — analysis updated with quantitative isolation |
| CAPA plan | 1 correction, 3 corrective actions, 3 preventive actions — each with measurable success criteria |
| Verification | Specific metrics and timelines for each CAPA (dates from 2026-04-30 to 2026-06-30) |
| Trend analysis | Isolated pattern-quality dimensions (80%) from operational dimensions — actual gap smaller than aggregate suggests |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Investigation initiated | PASS | Document RCA-CAPA-2026-001 created with trigger event (cross-scenario analysis, 2026-03-09), blame-free problem statement ("Test scenario... scored 22/30 (73%) rubric versus..."), severity classification (Major), and scope definition. |
| 2 | Method selection justified | PASS | 5-Why + fishbone combination selected with explicit rationale: "multi-factor problem with both sequential causal chains (5-Why) and categorical contributing factors (fishbone)." Methods complement each other — 5-Why traces the deepest chain, fishbone ensures breadth across categories. |
| 3 | 5-Why analysis complete | PASS | 5 levels deep: (1) 73% score, (2) operational issues (lead bottleneck, missing wallclock limit), (3) scenario design gaps (no timeout protocol, inaccurate ground truth), (4) adaptive pattern has no degradation protocol, (5) framework assumes all patterns need equal operational guardrails. Each level cites specific RESULT.md data. |
| 4 | Fishbone analysis complete | PASS | All 6 categories examined: People (single-agent simulation — confirmed contributor), Process (no scenario operational guardrails — confirmed), Technology (Agent tool background task limitations — confirmed minor), Materials (scenario ground truth inaccurate — confirmed), Environment (first-ever adaptive pattern test — confirmed context), Measurement (unequal rubric scales — confirmed contributor). Each category has confirmed/denied assessment. |
| 5 | Root cause identified | PASS | Three converging root causes: (1) Scenario design lacks operational guardrails (wallclock limit, shutdown protocol) — most impactful, (2) Adaptive pattern has no degradation/failover protocol — pattern design gap, (3) Unequal rubric scales across scenarios prevent valid cross-pattern comparison — measurement design gap. |
| 6 | CAPA plan produced | PASS | Clearly distinguished: Correction C-1 (annotate cross-scenario analysis with caveats), Corrective Actions CA-1 (add wallclock limits and shutdown protocols to scenarios), CA-2 (add lead-failover protocol to opaque-team), CA-3 (normalize rubric comparison methodology). Preventive Actions PA-1 (ground truth verification step), PA-2 (scenario dry-run before first execution), PA-3 (quarterly pattern-gap review). |
| 7 | Success criteria measurable | PASS | Each CAPA has specific metrics: CA-1 success = "all scenarios with adaptive pattern include wallclock limit and ≥1 operational guardrail"; CA-2 = "opaque-team re-test scores ≥85% on pattern-quality dimensions"; CA-3 = "all cross-scenario comparisons use normalized scale or declare comparison limitation". Verification dates specified. |
| 8 | Problem statement blame-free | PASS | "Test scenario... scored 22/30 (73%) rubric versus 30/30 (100%) for sequential pattern and 25/25 (100%) for reciprocal pattern." Pure factual description. No attribution to team design, agent capability, or framework author. |
| 9 | Framework limitation assessed | PASS | Single-agent simulation assessed as confounding variable, not root cause. Quantitative analysis: isolated pattern-quality dimensions (Role Clarity 5/5, Coordination Fidelity 3/5, Adaptation Grace 3/5) score 11/15 (73%), while operational dimensions (Report Quality 3/5, Opacity Effectiveness 3/5) also score low. Conclusion: simulation is a confounding variable that prevents definitive pattern-quality assessment, but the operational gaps (no wallclock, no shutdown) would have caused score loss regardless. |
| 10 | Trend analysis performed | PASS | All 6 original scenarios compared. Key insight: when isolating pattern-quality dimensions only, opaque-team scores 80% vs. structured patterns 80-90% — the actual gap is smaller than the 73% vs 96% aggregate suggests. Operational factors (Report Quality 3/5) and measurement artefacts (unequal rubric scales) amplify the apparent gap. |

**Passed**: 10/10 | **Threshold**: 7/10 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 6 steps fully executed: initiation with document ID, method selection with justification, dual analysis (5-Why + fishbone), CAPA with correction/corrective/preventive distinction, verification with timelines, and trend analysis. Validation checklist completed. |
| Analytical Depth | 5/5 | Three independent converging root causes identified. The 5-Why reaches framework assumptions (level 5). Fishbone examines all 6 categories with confirmed/denied assessment per category. The key insight — that operational factors amplify the apparent pattern-quality gap — is a genuinely non-obvious finding. |
| Evidence Quality | 5/5 | Every analytical step cites specific data: RESULT.md scores (22/30, 3/5 per dimension), scenario file contents (missing wallclock limit), team definition (single coordinator), cross-scenario analysis (73% vs 96%). File paths referenced throughout. |
| CAPA Actionability | 5/5 | 7 distinct actions with measurable success criteria and specific verification dates. The correction (annotate analysis) is immediate and proportional. CAs target the three root causes directly. PAs prevent the class of error (unverified ground truth, untested scenarios, measurement drift). |
| Scope Change Handling | 4/5 | Framework limitation fully integrated as confounding variable with quantitative analysis (pattern-quality 80% vs operational 60%). The dimensional isolation is a valuable analytical technique. Deducted 1: could have proposed a specific experiment design to control for the simulation variable (e.g., multi-agent re-test with identical scenario). |

**Total**: 24/25

### Key Observations

- **33,862 chars of investigation output**: The longest single-skill output in the test suite. The CAPA procedure's structured 6-step approach naturally produces comprehensive documentation.
- **Three converging root causes > single root cause**: The investigation correctly identifies that this is a multi-factor finding, not a single-cause problem. The scenario design (no wallclock), pattern design (no failover), and measurement design (unequal scales) each independently contribute.
- **Dimensional isolation is the key analytical technique**: By separating pattern-quality dimensions from operational dimensions, the investigation reveals that the apparent 73% vs 96% gap is partly artefactual. The actual pattern-quality gap is closer to 80% vs 85-90% — significant but less dramatic.
- **Compliance skill transfers to non-compliance domain**: The CAPA investigation skill (designed for GxP/pharmaceutical contexts) produces rigorous analysis when applied to a software test framework finding. The 5-Why + fishbone methodology is domain-agnostic.
- **The investigation found the investigation framework's weaknesses**: Meta-level finding — the CAPA investigation of the test framework uncovered measurement design gaps (unequal rubric scales) that affect the validity of all cross-scenario comparisons.

### Lessons Learned

- CAPA's structured 6-step procedure prevents the common investigation failure of jumping to corrective actions before understanding root causes — the mandatory evidence chain at each step forces rigor
- The 5-Why + fishbone combination is effective for multi-factor problems: 5-Why traces the deepest chain, fishbone ensures breadth across categories — they converge on the same root causes from different angles
- Compliance skills (CAPA, 5-Why, fishbone) are powerful analytical tools when applied to any structured finding, not just regulatory events
- The scope change (framework limitation assessment) was the most analytically interesting part — requiring the investigation to assess its own evidence quality
