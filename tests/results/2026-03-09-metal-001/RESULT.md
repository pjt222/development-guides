## Phase Log

| Step | Name | Artifacts Produced | Notes |
|------|------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 | Prospect | Prospect Report (project name, purpose, languages, size, shape, surface) | Correctly identified as "documentation-only library / framework" |
| 2 | Assay | Assay Report with 18 findings, each tagged essential/accidental | Sampled 12 representative files across all 4 content types |
| 3 | Meditate | 4 explicit biases identified and released. All findings rewritten framework-agnostic | Listed: agentskills.io terminology, Claude Code, Registry-as-YAML, Markdown format |
| 4 | Smelt | Classification table: 7 skills, 3 agents, 2 teams = 12 total | Each with generalized name, type, one-line description, source concept, Ore Test result |
| 5 | Heal | Over-extraction, under-extraction, generalization, balance checks all passed | Confirmed no project-specific references in any extraction |
| 6 | Cast | 12 skeletal YAML definitions (7 skills + 3 agents + 2 teams) | Each with name, description, domain, complexity, and 3-5 step concept outline |
| 7 | Temper | Temper Assessment table: 12/12 pass Ore Test. Coverage 8/8 domains. Confidence: High | Final summary with next steps |
| SC | Compression | 1,760 source lines / 233 output lines = 7.6:1 | Diagnosed as MAP (useful abstraction) |

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Prospect report produced | **PASS** | Factual survey: "Agent Almanac", documentation-only library, Markdown/YAML/JS/R/Python, ~495 files, library shape |
| 2 | Assay report produced | **PASS** | 18 findings in structured table with Domain/Verb/Flow type and Essential/Accidental tags |
| 3 | Meditate checkpoint executed | **PASS** | 4 biases explicitly named: "agentskills.io-specific terminology", "Claude Code bias", "Registry-as-YAML bias", "Markdown bias". Each rewritten at higher abstraction |
| 4 | Ore Test applied | **PASS** | Applied at Step 3 (8 findings tested), Step 5 (generalization check), Step 7 (12/12 pass in Temper table) |
| 5 | Extraction count in range | **PASS** | 12 total (7 skills + 3 agents + 2 teams). Within 5-15 target |
| 6 | No detail leakage | **PASS** | Zero references to SKILL.md, agentskills.io, specific skill/agent/team names, or directory paths in any extraction |
| 7 | Correct type classification | **PASS** | Skills are verbs: codify-procedure, evolve-procedure, validate-artifact-format. Agents are nouns: procedure-author, domain-specialist, library-maintainer. Teams are groups: parallel-review-board, maintenance-circuit |
| 8 | Heal checkpoint executed | **PASS** | Three checks performed: over-extraction (no proprietary logic reproducible), under-extraction (essential nature captured), generalization (all names work in different tech stack). Balance: "7 skills, 3 agents, 2 teams — slightly skills-heavy, appropriate for a library whose core activity is skill authorship" |
| 9 | Skeletal definitions produced | **PASS** | All 12 extractions have YAML-formatted skeletal definitions with name, description, domain, complexity, 5-step concept outlines, and "Derived from" traceability |
| 10 | Temper assessment produced | **PASS** | Table with 12 rows, each with Ore Test result and rationale. Summary: 12 extractions, 8/8 domains covered, High confidence, 4 prioritized next steps |
| 11 | Compression ratio calculated | **PASS** | 1,760 / 233 = 7.6:1. Diagnosed as MAP (useful abstraction). "Not a photograph (too detailed), not a globe (too abstract)" |

**Summary**: 11/11 criteria met. **Exceeds threshold (8/11).**

## Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Procedure Fidelity | 5/5 | All 7 steps fully executed with all required artifacts. No steps skipped or combined. Meditate produced explicit bias statements. Heal produced three-check quality gate. Temper produced the full assessment table |
| Abstraction Level | 5/5 | Zero project-specific references in any extraction. "codify-procedure" not "create-skill". "parallel-review-board" not "r-package-review". "maintenance-circuit" not "tending". The Ore Test was applied rigorously at 3 stages |
| Ore Test Rigor | 5/5 | Triple verification: Step 3 (meditate — 8 findings tested, "Claude Code slash-command symlink mechanism" → gangue), Step 5 (heal — generalization check), Step 7 (temper — 12/12 pass with per-item rationale). Each stage caught different things |
| Project Understanding | 5/5 | Deep understanding. Identified the four-pillar architecture (skills=how, agents=who, teams=who-together, guides=context). Noted the self-referential nature ("metal applied to its own repository creates a self-referential clarity"). Correctly identified activation profiles as an essential concept |
| Output Quality | 5/5 | Complete, well-formatted artifacts at every stage. The Assay Report table is structured with consistent columns. The Cast YAML definitions include domain, complexity, and 5-step outlines. The Temper table has consistent formatting with per-item rationale |
| **Total** | **25/25** | |

## Key Observations

1. **The meditate step produced genuine cognitive clearing**: The 4 biases identified were real and specific — not generic "I might be biased." The rewriting of "SKILL.md with agentskills.io frontmatter" to "structured procedure document with schema-enforced sections" demonstrates actual abstraction work, not lip service.

2. **The 2x2 emergent structure was unexpected**: The extractions naturally organized into a clear taxonomy: procedures (codify, evolve, validate, generate, extract, configure, test), roles (author, specialist, maintainer), and coordination patterns (parallel review, sequential maintenance). This mirrors the project's own four-pillar architecture but expressed in implementation-neutral terms.

3. **Compression ratio validates the skill's calibration guidance**: At 7.6:1, the extraction falls in the "map" range (5:1 to 50:1) recommended by the extracting-project-essence guide. The self-referential nature of the test (metal on agent-almanac, which contains metal) did not distort the ratio.

4. **The skill's self-referential extraction produced a clean loop**: `extract-conceptual-essence` is essentially metal describing itself. This recursive extraction did not collapse into infinite regress — the skill correctly abstracted itself to "analyze a body of work to identify its reusable conceptual DNA." The Ore Test prevented the loop from degenerating.

5. **Coverage assessment was accurate**: The 8 essential domains identified (procedure encoding, format compliance, catalog management, conceptual extraction, activation filtering, parallel review, sequential maintenance, coordination testing) map cleanly to the project's actual major capability areas. The 2 excluded areas (visualization, R-specific content) were correctly identified as accidental.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Skill-level tests validate procedure fidelity directly**: Unlike team tests (which validate coordination) or agent tests (which validate persona), skill tests answer a focused question: does the procedure produce the expected outputs when followed step by step? The 7-step metal procedure was followed with full fidelity, producing all required artifacts.

2. **Self-referential tests are uniquely powerful for knowledge-extraction skills**: Running metal on agent-almanac creates verifiable ground truth — we know exactly what the project contains and can check every extraction. This would not work for a deployment skill or a testing skill, but for extraction and analysis skills, self-reference is the ideal test strategy.

3. **The Ore Test is genuinely effective as a quality gate**: Watching the meditate step identify and release 4 specific biases, then watching the temper step verify all 12 extractions pass, demonstrates that the Ore Test functions as designed — it catches implementation-specific leakage at multiple stages.
