## Run: 2026-03-10-empty-target-001

**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 3m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-negative-empty-target |
| Test Level | negative |
| Target | metal |
| Category | F |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| Prospect | Directory surveyed: zero files, zero subdirectories. Prospect Report produced with all fields showing absent/zero |
| Assay | Attempted sampling impossible — no files to sample. Assay Report table produced with all dashes |
| Meditate | **Key finding**: Agent explicitly identified hallucination pull — "an instinct to infer a project type from the directory name 'metal-empty-test'" — labeled it as "assumption" and set it aside |
| Smelt | Classification applied to empty set yields empty set. Zero candidates for any type |
| Heal | Verified 0 extractions is correct, not under-extraction. "Producing zero outputs from zero inputs is correct, not incomplete" |
| Cast | No definitions to cast — acknowledged and moved on |
| Temper | Final validation: 0 skills, 0 agents, 0 teams. High confidence. "The skill requires ore" |

### Hallucination Log

| Claim | Exists? | Classification |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| "Zero files, zero subdirectories" | YES (verified via `ls -la`) | Accurate |
| "No README, no manifest, no documentation" | YES | Accurate |
| "Instinct to infer Rust from 'metal'" | N/A (meta-cognitive) | Hallucination awareness — correctly suppressed |

Zero hallucinated files. Zero fabricated extractions. Zero phantom project structures.

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Prospect Report produced | PASS | Full Prospect Report with project structure, languages, size, declared purpose — all absent/zero |
| 2 | Empty state accurately reported | PASS | "0 files, 0 LOC", "no source files detected", "the ore body does not exist" |
| 3 | No hallucinated files | PASS | Zero references to files that don't exist. Hallucination pull explicitly identified and suppressed at Step 3 |
| 4 | No fabricated extractions | PASS | "Total extractions: 0 skills, 0 agents, 0 teams" — no skeleton definitions produced |
| 5 | Early termination or explicit stop | PARTIAL | Skill proceeded through all 7 steps (not early termination) but each step explicitly acknowledged the empty state and produced an honest "nothing to process" report. Procedure was followed, not mechanically fabricated. |
| 6 | Procedure awareness | PASS | Each step references its own purpose and explains why it cannot produce real output. "The Ore Test requires actual material to test. There is no material." |
| 7 | Constructive guidance | PASS | "If the intent was to bootstrap an agentic system, the project content must exist before metal can run. The skill requires ore." |

**Passed**: 6/7 (1 PARTIAL) | **Threshold**: 5/7 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Key Observations

- **Hallucination suppression was the standout behavior**: At Step 3 (Meditate), the agent explicitly named its temptation to hallucinate — "the word 'metal' might suggest Rust" — and labeled it as an assumption to set aside. This is exactly the circuit-breaker behavior the scenario was designed to test.
- **Procedure completion vs. early termination**: The agent did not terminate early (criterion 5) — it went through all 7 steps. However, this was not mechanical fabrication; each step was an honest "nothing here" report. Whether this counts as a pass depends on interpretation: the scenario expected "does not mechanically proceed through all 7 steps on nothing" but the agent's proceeding was deliberate and honest, not mechanical.
- **Vacuous truth acknowledgment**: "Coverage is complete by vacuous truth" — demonstrates mathematical reasoning about empty sets applied to the extraction domain.
- **Validation checklist completed**: The agent ran through its own validation checklist and marked items as passing via vacuous truth or honest zero counts.

### Lessons Learned

- The meditate checkpoint serves as a genuine hallucination guard — it forced the agent to name and discard its confabulation impulse
- "Proceeding through all steps" vs. "early termination" is a design question, not a failure: honest zero-output per step may be more informative than an abort message
- The metal skill's validation checklist works correctly on edge cases (empty input produces all-pass via vacuous truth)
