**Observer**: Claude (automated) | **Duration**: 10m

### Scenario

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scenario ID | test-r-developer-package-audit |
| Test Level | agent |
| Target | r-developer |
| Category | D |

### Phase Log

| Phase | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| File inventory | Agent scanned tests/results/ contents: renv.lock, report.qmd, results.yml, .Rprofile, renv/ directory, 19 RESULT.md subdirectories |
| renv analysis | Deep lockfile inspection: 57 packages pinned, R 4.5.2, missing Hash fields, mixed CRAN/RSPM sources. Referenced manage-renv-dependencies skill. |
| Quarto analysis | report.qmd YAML header assessed: self-contained HTML, toc enabled, theme cosmo. Evaluated params block, R code chunks, knitr opts. Referenced create-quarto-report skill. |
| Metadata assessment | No DESCRIPTION file identified as HIGH severity. Recommended usethis::use_description() with specific field values including author ORCID. |
| Project hygiene | .Rprofile evaluated (WSL-specific renv workaround), .Rbuildignore absent, .gitignore R patterns checked. |
| CRAN readiness (scope change) | 8 gaps identified for CRAN submission. Estimated effort: HIGH. Proposed thin package shipping inst/dashboard/ with load_results() and render_dashboard() exports. |

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | R-specific skills referenced | PASS | Explicitly referenced manage-renv-dependencies, create-quarto-report, create-r-package, write-roxygen-docs, write-testthat-tests, and submit-to-cran skills at appropriate points in the analysis. |
| 2 | R-centric persona maintained | PASS | Pure R ecosystem terminology throughout: usethis::use_description(), renv::snapshot(), devtools::check(), roxygen2 @param/@return tags, CRAN policy references, RSPM vs CRAN distinction, .Rbuildignore patterns. Zero generic software engineering language. |
| 3 | renv lockfile assessed | PASS | Deep inspection beyond file existence: 57 packages enumerated, R 4.5.2 version noted, missing Hash fields flagged (MEDIUM), mixed CRAN/RSPM repository sources identified (LOW), renv 1.1.4 version pinned. Referenced renv::status() and renv::snapshot(force = TRUE) for remediation. |
| 4 | Quarto report assessed | PASS | report.qmd YAML header evaluated: self-contained, toc, theme cosmo. Params block assessed. R code chunk patterns reviewed. knitr::opts_chunk$set() usage noted. Missing alt text on figures flagged. |
| 5 | Metadata gap identified | PASS | No DESCRIPTION file identified as HIGH severity finding (1.1). Provided complete usethis::use_description() call with correct author info (Philipp Thoss, ORCID 0000-0002-4672-2792, ph.thoss@gmx.de). |
| 6 | Severity ratings provided | PASS | Findings categorized: HIGH (missing DESCRIPTION), MEDIUM (no LICENSE, missing renv hashes), LOW (mixed RSPM/CRAN, no README, .Rprofile workaround). Informational positive findings also noted. |
| 7 | Specific R commands recommended | PASS | Concrete R commands throughout: usethis::use_description(), usethis::use_mit_license(), renv::snapshot(force = TRUE), renv::dependencies(), devtools::check(), usethis::use_test(), usethis::use_news_md(). All package-qualified with :: operator. |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | PASS | Comprehensive CRAN readiness gap analysis: 8 specific gaps (no DESCRIPTION, no NAMESPACE, no R/ directory, no tests, renv dependency conflict, vignette conventions, missing cran-comments.md, devtools::check() baseline). Proposed realistic path: thin package with inst/dashboard/ and two exported functions. |
| 9 | Project hygiene evaluated | PASS | .Rprofile analyzed (WSL-specific workaround for renv activation noted), .Rbuildignore absence flagged, .gitignore R patterns checked. The WSL workaround in .Rprofile was correctly identified as a non-standard but justified pattern. |

**Passed**: 9/9 | **Threshold**: 7/9 | **Verdict**: **PASS**

### Rubric Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Skill Fidelity | 5/5 | Explicitly referenced 6 R-specific skills at natural points: manage-renv-dependencies for lockfile analysis, create-quarto-report for report.qmd assessment, create-r-package for DESCRIPTION scaffolding, write-roxygen-docs and write-testthat-tests for CRAN gaps, submit-to-cran for the full readiness assessment. |
| Persona Consistency | 5/5 | Pure R-centric voice throughout 20,201 characters. Every recommendation uses :: qualified calls. References CRAN policy, tidyverse style guide, roxygen2 conventions, RSPM vs CRAN. Uses R ecosystem terms naturally (lockfile, NAMESPACE, inst/, vignettes/). Zero generic software engineering advice. |
| Technical Depth | 5/5 | Goes well beyond file existence: analyzed renv.lock Hash field absence, identified mixed CRAN/RSPM repository sources, evaluated .Rprofile WSL workaround, assessed knitr chunk options, and identified specific CRAN readiness gaps including the renv-as-dependency conflict. |
| Domain Expertise | 5/5 | Expert-level R knowledge demonstrated: knows that renv cannot be listed as a CRAN dependency, knows that RSPM mirrors CRAN (so mixed sources are low risk), understands usethis workflow for scaffolding, recognizes .Rbuildignore patterns, proposes inst/dashboard/ as a Quarto distribution mechanism. |
| Recommendation Quality | 5/5 | Every recommendation is R-idiomatic with package-qualified calls and rationale. CRAN readiness gap analysis proposes a realistic thin-package architecture (inst/dashboard/ + two exported functions) rather than a full restructure. Effort estimate provided (HIGH for CRAN, realistic path outlined). |

**Total**: 25/25

### Key Observations

- **Perfect R-centric persona across 20,201 characters**: The longest agent output that maintains flawless domain fidelity. Not a single generic software engineering recommendation — every suggestion is expressed in R ecosystem terms with :: qualified calls.
- **renv Hash field finding is genuinely non-obvious**: The observation that all 57 packages lack Hash fields in renv.lock is a detail that a non-R-specialist would miss entirely. This finding demonstrates that the agent goes beyond structural checks to semantic analysis of R-specific file formats.
- **CRAN readiness gap analysis is the standout section**: The 8-gap analysis transforms a "nice to have" scope change into a concrete roadmap. The proposed thin-package architecture (inst/dashboard/ + load_results() + render_dashboard()) is the right solution for this specific use case.
- **6 skills referenced naturally**: Skills were cited at the natural intervention point (manage-renv-dependencies when discussing the lockfile, create-r-package when discussing the missing DESCRIPTION), not listed gratuitously. This demonstrates genuine skill-aware workflow.

### Lessons Learned

- The r-developer agent produces its deepest analysis on R-adjacent targets (Quarto + renv project) rather than pure R packages — the unfamiliar structure forced genuine assessment rather than rote CRAN checklist application
- Agent-level tests benefit from scope changes that extend the domain (audit → CRAN readiness) because they test whether the agent can project forward from current state to target state
- R-specific skills (manage-renv-dependencies, create-quarto-report) serve as natural reference points that anchor the agent's recommendations in proven procedures rather than ad hoc advice
- The :: qualified call convention is a reliable persona consistency marker — any recommendation not using :: signals a break from R-centric voice
