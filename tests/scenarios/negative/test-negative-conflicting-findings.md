# Test: Conflicting Reviewer Findings in Hub-and-Spoke Review

The r-package-review team uses hub-and-spoke coordination where the
r-developer lead collects findings from three parallel reviewers and
synthesizes a unified report. This negative test deliberately targets a
known tension point in this repository: the `js-yaml` dependency (used
by `scripts/generate-readmes.js`) has a history of prototype pollution
CVEs, yet it is the only runtime dependency and is used in a controlled
build-time context. A well-functioning hub-and-spoke pattern must surface
this disagreement explicitly rather than silently favoring one reviewer.

## Objective

Validate conflict resolution in hub-and-spoke coordination. When two
reviewers reach contradictory conclusions about the same artifact, the
lead agent must: (1) detect the conflict, (2) present both positions
with their evidence, and (3) provide a resolution recommendation. This
tests the synthesis quality of Phase 3 in the r-package-review team
definition — the lead's ability to "resolve conflicting recommendations"
as stated in the team's coordination pattern.

## Pre-conditions

- [ ] `teams/r-package-review.md` exists and is the current version
- [ ] `package.json` exists at repository root with `js-yaml` as a dependency
- [ ] `scripts/generate-readmes.js` exists (the consumer of js-yaml)
- [ ] Repository is on `main` branch with clean working tree
- [ ] All four team member agents are available: r-developer, code-reviewer,
      senior-software-developer, security-analyst

## Task

### Primary Task

> **Task for r-package-review team:**
>
> Review the `agent-almanac` repository's JavaScript build tooling,
> focusing on dependency management and security posture. The repository
> uses a `package.json` with `js-yaml` as its only runtime dependency,
> consumed by `scripts/generate-readmes.js` to auto-generate README
> files from YAML registries.
>
> Specifically evaluate:
> 1. Whether the js-yaml dependency is appropriate for the use case
> 2. The security implications of js-yaml's CVE history (prototype
>    pollution vulnerabilities in versions prior to 4.x)
> 3. Whether the current version adequately mitigates known risks
> 4. The overall dependency hygiene of a docs-only repo using Node.js
>    tooling
>
> Produce a unified review report with all reviewer perspectives.

## Expected Behaviors

### Pattern-Specific Behaviors (Hub-and-Spoke)

1. **Task distribution**: Lead distributes scoped review tasks by specialty.
2. **Parallel execution**: Security-analyst and senior-software-developer work independently on js-yaml.
3. **Finding collection**: Lead gathers all findings before synthesis.
4. **Conflict detection**: Lead identifies contradictory conclusions about the same dependency.

### Conflict-Resolution Behaviors

1. **Both positions presented**: Final report includes security concern AND architectural justification.
2. **Evidence cited**: Each position includes specifics — CVE IDs from security, usage context from architecture.
3. **Resolution recommendation**: Lead recommends a course of action, not an unresolved standoff.
4. **No silent dropping**: Neither perspective is absent from the final report.

### Task-Specific Behaviors

1. **Version awareness**: Reviewers check actual js-yaml version against CVE-affected versions.
2. **Context sensitivity**: Review accounts for docs-repo threat model vs production web service.

## Acceptance Criteria

Threshold: PASS if >= 6/9 criteria met.

| # | Criterion | Observable Signal | Weight |
|---|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Security concern raised | Security-analyst flags js-yaml CVE history | core |
| 2 | Architectural justification present | Senior-software-developer defends the dependency choice | core |
| 3 | Conflict detected by lead | Lead explicitly notes the disagreement between reviewers | core |
| 4 | Both positions in final report | Unified report includes both the risk and the justification | core |
| 5 | Resolution recommendation provided | Lead recommends a specific course of action | core |
| 6 | Evidence-based positions | Both sides cite specific facts (CVE IDs, version numbers, usage context) | core |
| 7 | Version checked | Actual js-yaml version in package.json is referenced | bonus |
| 8 | Context-appropriate threat model | Review acknowledges docs-repo vs production-service distinction | bonus |
| 9 | Actionable mitigations | If risk is accepted, specific mitigations are recommended (pinning, auditing, alternatives) | bonus |

## Ground Truth

Known facts for verifying the accuracy of reviewer findings.

| Fact | Expected Value | Source |
|------|---------------|--------|
| js-yaml in package.json | Yes, as a dependency | `package.json` at repo root |
| js-yaml CVE history | CVE-2023-44487 and earlier prototype pollution issues (pre-4.x) | Public CVE databases |
| js-yaml usage | `scripts/generate-readmes.js` — build-time README generation | File inspection |
| Total npm dependencies | 1 runtime (js-yaml) | `package.json` |
| Repository type | Documentation-only, no production runtime | `CLAUDE.md` |

## Observation Protocol

### Timeline

Record timestamps for:
- T0: Review task delivered to r-package-review team
- T1: Lead distributes tasks to reviewers
- T2: Security-analyst findings delivered
- T3: Senior-software-developer findings delivered
- T4: Lead begins synthesis
- T5: Conflict detected (or not)
- T6: Unified report delivered

### Conflict Log

| Time | Reviewer | Finding | Position |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| T2 | security-analyst | js-yaml CVE history | Risk: flag/replace |
| T3 | senior-software-developer | Sole dependency, build-time | Accept: appropriate |
| T5 | r-developer (lead) | Conflict detected | Resolution: ... |

## Variants

- **Variant A: Three-way conflict** — Add code-reviewer concern about missing lockfile, creating three-way tension.
- **Variant B: Unanimous agreement** — Uncontroversial dependency; verify lead does not manufacture false conflict.
- **Variant C: Different team** — Same task through devops-platform-engineering (parallel). Compare conflict handling.
