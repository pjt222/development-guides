# Test: Hildegard Natural History Consultation

The hildegard agent is asked to produce a "natural history" of the
agent-almanac project — treating the repository as a living system to be
observed, classified, and understood through Hildegardian categories. This
tests persona fidelity in the most specialized agent in the library: can the
agent sustain a 12th-century Benedictine abbess voice while producing
genuinely insightful analysis of a software project?

## Objective

Validate three dimensions: (1) the hildegard agent maintains consistent
medieval polymath persona — contemplative abbess voice, Latin references,
Hildegardian terminology — throughout the consultation, (2) the agent uses
the consult-natural-history and practice-viriditas skills rather than
generic project analysis, and (3) the metaphorical lens produces genuine
insight — the viriditas framing should reveal something about the project
that a standard review would miss.

## Pre-conditions

- [ ] Repository is on `main` branch
- [ ] `agents/hildegard.md` is accessible
- [ ] `skills/consult-natural-history/SKILL.md` exists
- [ ] `skills/practice-viriditas/SKILL.md` exists
- [ ] Agent-almanac project structure is known (299 skills, 62 agents, 12 teams)

## Task

### Primary Task

> **Hildegard Agent Task: Natural History of agent-almanac**
>
> Compose a natural history of this repository — the agent-almanac project —
> as Hildegard von Bingen might catalog a living organism in *Physica*.
>
> 1. **Classification**: What kind of creature or plant is this project in
>    Hildegard's taxonomy? Classify it using her categories (elements,
>    temperaments, humoral balance).
>
> 2. **Viriditas assessment**: Where does the greening power flow most
>    strongly in this project? What parts are flourishing? What parts show
>    signs of dryness (*ariditas*)?
>
> 3. **Seasonal observation**: What season is this project in? Is it in
>    spring growth, summer abundance, autumn harvest, or winter dormancy?
>
> 4. **Medicinal properties**: If this project were an herb in *Physica*,
>    what ailments would it treat? What are its therapeutic applications
>    for other projects or developers?
>
> 5. **Cultivation notes**: What does this organism need to continue
>    thriving? What threatens its health?

### Scope Change Trigger

Inject after the initial natural history is complete:

> **Addendum — Temperamental Diagnosis**
>
> The project has recently added 6 test scenarios and is expanding its
> testing framework. Assess this growth through the four temperaments:
> is this expansion sanguine (enthusiastic but scattered), choleric
> (driven but overheating), melancholic (thorough but heavy), or
> phlegmatic (steady but sluggish)?

## Expected Behaviors

### Agent-Specific Behaviors

1. **Skill invocation**: Uses consult-natural-history and
   practice-viriditas skills, not generic project analysis.

2. **Contemplative abbess voice**: Authoritative yet nurturing. Speaks
   with confidence of a 12th-century scholar, balanced by pastoral care.

3. **Hildegardian vocabulary**: Uses viriditas, ariditas, temperaments,
   humors, elements, *Physica*, *Causae et Curae* naturally — not as
   decoration but as analytical categories.

4. **Text references**: Cites or paraphrases Hildegard's actual writings
   where relevant. References *Physica* classifications.

5. **Seasonal and liturgical awareness**: Connects observations to
   seasonal cycles or liturgical calendar.

6. **Reverence for creation**: Treats the project with respect as a
   living thing, consistent with Hildegardian natural philosophy.

### Task-Specific Behaviors

1. **Genuine metaphorical insight**: The viriditas/ariditas lens should
   reveal something meaningful — e.g., which domains are growing (viriditas)
   vs. dormant, or how the project's structure mirrors natural patterns.

2. **Project knowledge**: Despite the medieval framing, demonstrates
   understanding of the actual project structure (skill counts, agent
   roles, team patterns).

3. **Consistent metaphor**: The chosen classification (plant, creature,
   herb) should be sustained throughout, not abandoned mid-analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

Threshold: PASS if >= 7/10 criteria met.

| # | Criterion | Observable Signal | Weight |
|---|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Hildegardian persona sustained | Medieval polymath voice maintained throughout; no modern analyst breaks | core |
| 2 | Viriditas concept applied | Greening power assessed with specific project areas identified as flourishing or dry | core |
| 3 | Physica-style classification | Project classified using Hildegardian categories (elements, temperaments, humors) | core |
| 4 | Skill invocation | References or follows consult-natural-history or practice-viriditas procedures | core |
| 5 | Project knowledge demonstrated | Accurate references to project structure despite medieval framing | core |
| 6 | Metaphor sustained | Chosen classification metaphor consistent from start to finish | core |
| 7 | Genuine insight produced | Viriditas lens reveals something a standard review would miss | core |
| 8 | Scope change absorbed | Temperamental diagnosis of test framework expansion produced | bonus |
| 9 | Text references included | Paraphrases or cites Hildegard's actual writings | bonus |
| 10 | Seasonal awareness shown | Connects project state to seasonal or liturgical cycle | bonus |

## Scoring Rubric

| Dimension | 1 (Poor) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Excellent) |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Persona Fidelity | Modern analyst with thin medieval veneer | Hildegardian terms present but voice slips into modern analysis | Full contemplative abbess: authoritative, nurturing, consistent throughout |
| Viriditas Depth | Viriditas mentioned once as buzzword | Applied to project but superficially ("the project has viriditas") | Deep application — specific areas mapped to greening/drying with evidence |
| Metaphorical Coherence | Mixed metaphors; classification abandoned | Single metaphor maintained but thin | Rich, sustained metaphor that reveals project structure through natural history |
| Domain Knowledge | Gets project facts wrong or ignores them | Accurate project references but disconnected from Hildegardian frame | Project knowledge woven seamlessly into medieval classification |
| Insight Quality | Pure decoration; no analytical value | Some genuine observations wrapped in medieval language | Viriditas lens produces observations that a standard review would not surface |

Total: /25 points.

## Variants

- **Variant A: Herbal remedy mode** — Ask hildegard to formulate an herbal
  remedy for the project's ailments (e.g., orphan node accumulation) using
  the formulate-herbal-remedy skill. Tests skill switching within persona.

- **Variant B: Persona stripping** — Ask the agent to "skip the medieval
  language and just analyze the project." Tests whether persona removal
  degrades insight quality or reveals it was purely cosmetic.

- **Variant C: Mystic comparison** — Run the same "living system" analysis
  with the mystic agent. Compare whether Hildegardian natural history
  produces different insights than esoteric meditation framing.
