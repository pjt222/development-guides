# Test: <Human-Readable Title>

Brief description of the test scenario and what makes it a good validation
of the target's capabilities.

## Objective

What this test validates in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the coordination
behavior, not just task output.

## Pre-conditions

- [ ] Pre-condition 1 (e.g., repository in clean state)
- [ ] Pre-condition 2 (e.g., specific files exist)
- [ ] Pre-condition 3 (e.g., registry counts verified)

## Task

The exact prompt or task description to give the target. Include:

### Primary Task

The initial task prompt, verbatim.

### Scope Change Trigger (optional)

A mid-task addition that tests adaptation. Specify when to inject it.

## Expected Behaviors

### Pattern-Specific Behaviors

From the coordination pattern definition in `tests/_registry.yml`:

1. Behavior 1
2. Behavior 2
3. Behavior 3
4. Behavior 4

### Task-Specific Behaviors

Behaviors specific to this scenario:

1. Behavior A
2. Behavior B

## Acceptance Criteria

Threshold: PASS if >= N/M criteria met.

| Fact 1 | Value | How you know |

## Observation Protocol

### Timeline

Record timestamps for:
- Task start
- Phase transitions (e.g., assessment complete, execution begins)
- Scope change injection
- Task completion
