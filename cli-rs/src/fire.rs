//! The reading light.
//!
//! A grimoire is read by firelight. This module models that fire as a single
//! `intensity` value in `0.0..=1.0` that decays toward a resting `floor` and
//! flares to full whenever the reader does something (a keypress, a page turn,
//! a search). When `--animate` is on, the resting state is not flat — the fire
//! breathes slowly. When it is off, the fire is steady except for the short
//! settling tail after a flare.
//!
//! The TUI reads `needs_ticks()` to decide whether to keep redrawing on a frame
//! clock or fall back to a long, CPU-friendly `event::poll` deadline.
